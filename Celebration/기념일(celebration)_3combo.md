# 1. Talk about gaterings or celebrations in Korea. what do people do when they celebrate or get together?
```
There is a traditional Korean celebration called Seollal, which is the Lunar New Year.
During this holiday, family members gather together to celebrate and catch up with one another.

One of the special dishes we eat is tteok-guk, which is rice-cake soup.
It’s made with sliced rice cakes, beef, eggs, and sometimes vegetables.
According to tradition, eating tteok-guk means you become one year older.

People also enjoy playing Yut-nori, which is a traditional Korean board game.
It’s simple but really fun, and many families enjoy playing it together during the holiday.

Another important tradition is holding a memorial service for ancestors.
It’s a meaningful way to show respect and remember family history.

These days, I see more people choosing to travel—either abroad or to nearby places—to spend the national holidays in a different way.

# 2. What did they do at their last gathering or celebration? What was the occasion?
```
At the last Seollal gathering, our family came together to celebrate the New Year and honor our ancestors.
It was a very special occasion because it was the first time the entire family had been able to meet in person in a long time.
The day started with everyone gathering around a large table filled with traditional foods like tteokguk (rice cake soup),
jeon (Korean pancakes), and a variety of fruits.
We took turns bowing to each other and exchanging New Year’s greetings, wishing each other good health and happiness.

They also performed ancestral rites, setting out offerings of food and drink for their ancestors and bowing in respect.
After the formal ceremonies were finished, the family spent the rest of the day playing games, sharing stories, and catching up on each other’s lives.
One of the favorite games was Yut-nori, a traditional Korean board game that involves throwing sticks and moving game pieces around a board.

As the night drew to a close, the family gathered once more for a final feast filled with delicious food and drink.
The atmosphere was full of warmth, love, and gratitude for the chance to be together again.

Overall, the Seollal gathering was a joyful occasion filled with meaningful traditions, amazing food, and cherished moments of togetherness.
It was a beautiful reminder of the importance of family.

# 3. Talk about a memorable incident that happened at a gathering or a celebration. What happened?
```
At a family gathering for Seollal, everyone was sitting down to enjoy a big feast of traditional Korean dishes.
As they were passing around steaming bowls of food, one of the younger children accidentally spilled a bowl of doenjang jjigae
all over their grandmother’s lap.

At first, everyone was shocked and didn’t know what to do.
But the grandmother simply laughed and said it was no big deal—accidents happen!
She quickly got up to change her clothes, while the rest of the family rushed to clean up the mess.

Despite the unexpected incident, the rest of the gathering continued with even more laughter and joy.
The family worked together to finish preparing the food, and everyone sat down again to enjoy the delicious spread.

In the end, the accident actually brought the family even closer together and became a funny and fond memory.
To this day, they still talk about it and laugh.
It was a reminder that sometimes, the most unexpected moments can create the most unforgettable memories.
