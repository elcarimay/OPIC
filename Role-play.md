# I am going to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You have just moved to a new place. Call the front desk and ask three to four questions about the recycling system in the area.
```
Can you tell me where the recycling bins in the room?
Are there separate wastebaskets for paper, plastic, glass, and metal?
When the recycling is picked up?
What kind of materials can be recycled here?
How often are the recycling bins emptied?
Is there anything else I should be aware of when it comes to recycling in this area?
