## 1) You indicated in your survey that you like to watch sport games. What kinds of game do you like to watch? Why do you like to watch games? When do you usually watch them? Where do you normally watch them? Who do you usually watch them with?  
```
I usually like watching sports games on TV. I used to watch a lot of basketball games, but these days I
almost watch baseball games. It's so fun to watch the TV program's strongest baseball every Monday evening recently.
Players who used to play in professional teams create new clubs after retirement and play. They're playing mainly
with high school and university players and independent league players even though they are old. It is encouraging
and comforting for me. The problem is that I have to watch it for two hours from 10:30 p.m. to 12:30 p.m.,
but I'm a little tired the next morning. Of course, I can see the recording, but it's not lively. So I take care
of it every Monday night. While watching them, I am able to focus only on the games forgetting all problems I have.
When the team or player I cheer for wins, it is even better!! All stress is gone!

## 2) Do you have any favorite player? Who is it? Why do you like him or her? What kind of sport does she or he play? Tell me about him or her in as much detail as possible.  
```
I like and respect all athletes. Picking one of them is quiet difficult but I tend to pay extra attentions to
athletes that the media focus since they are exposed to people more than others. Recently, I am interested in
soccer player Son Heung-min, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur. Although he received harsh training from his
father from an early age, he endured to the end and became a great player, captain of the national team,
and captain of the English Premier League, the birthplace of soccer. Son Heung-min is famous for using both
feet well, so it is impossible to predict how he will move from the perspective of defenders. It is so
admirable to see Asian player playing his own ability without shrinking at all among good physical foreign players.
In addition, the friendly appearance of supporting colleagues' surgery expenses, such as politeness during interviews,
shows that he is not just a good soccer player. I hope he will continue to establish himself as a legendary player
in soccer history not only in Korea but also around the world with good skills. I wish him the best!!!

## 3) Do you have any memorable experience while watching the sport games? When was it? What kinds of game did you watch? Why was it so memorable to you?  
```
I must say the most memorable experience I have ever had was one in this year. My family watched a soccer game at 4:30  
p.m. on Saturday. About 19,000 people came to watch the game so it was crowded with people. It was a match between Suwon  
Samsung vs. FC Seoul. The weather was so hot that I charged a portable fan and went there, but it was so really very hot.  
During lunchtime, a singer named Park Jae-jeong, a hot singer these days, came and sang "Let's say goodbye," but the sound
quality was bad because it was a big playground, but it was so lively and good to hear it in front of your eyes.
If I see it at home, I can't see other players because TV camera is focused only on the ball, but when I come to the
stadium, it was so good to see all the players' movements on the soccer field and cheer for each team.
I decided to leave five minutes early before the end of the game because I thought traffic would be bad. When we got out  
of our seats and tried to get out of the exit, I was surprised and slightly annoyed because the goal was scored.  
Anyway, my wife said that she watched a soccer game for the first time, and it was a good experience for my family.
