## 1) You indicated in your survey that you like to watch sport games. What kinds of game do you like to watch? Why do you like to watch games? When do you usually watch them? Where do you normally watch them? Who do you usually watch them with?

I was not very interested in watching sport games at all but when my friend invited me to watch a soccer
game in 2002, I fell in love with it. I realized watching games on TV can capture less than 1 tenth of the games.
Ever since, I love to watch a sport games usually soccer game in the stadium. I usually go to the stadium with
my friend who invited me first. Unfortunately I do not have a lot of friends who can enjoy soccer as I do. When
soccer season starts, it is the time for me to get really busy to book tickets for the games and arrange my
schedule around them. I also like to watch baseball. Unfortunately I usually watch it on TV because my favorite
player is not playing in Korea. But whenever I have a chance to watch his game with my eyes, I will go to any
place. Last year I visited LA to watch his game. It was fun. Primary reason for me to enjoy watching sport games
is that, while watching them, I am able to focus only on the games forgetting all problems I have. When the
team or player I cheer for wins, it is even better!! All stress is gone!

## 2) Do you have any favorite player? Who is it? Why do you like him or her? What kind of sport does she or he play? Tell me about him or her in as much detail as possible.

I like and respect all athletes. Picking one of them is quiet difficult but I tend to pay extra attentions to
athletes that the media focus since they are exposed to people more than others. Recently I have been
interested in Ryu Hyun Jin who is a pitcher of LA Dodgers. Last year I had chance to watch one of his game in
the stadium and I realized he is the athlete with a great potential. He has no hesitation when he is on the
mound. He is now my favorite athlete. He is young pitcher drafted to Major League right after school. LA
Dodgers is his first team. His is very tall with built figure. Some may say he is little big but I think he needs that
figure to pitch. Despite his figure, he is pretty fast when he is running in the ball park. He has tanned skin. He
seems humorous seen on TV programs. I like him because he is an athlete with determination and commitment.
He always does his best even when he plays as a hitter. He has accomplished 14 wins so far this year. I wish him
the best!!!

## 3) Do you have any memorable experience while watching the sport games? When was it? What kinds of game did you watch? Why was it so memorable to you?  
```
I must say the most memorable experience I have ever had was one in 2002. In 2002, the World Cup was
held in Korea. It was the year only Korea held the World Cup but also Korean national team went to semi-final.
Sensational, isnâ€™t it!!! I was lucky enough to get a seat of the world cup stadium because not many people did
not expect Korean team to be on the semi-final, when my friend purchased the tickets, we were able to buy the
tickets with great seat relatively effortless. It was actually the game that Korean team lost but it was very
emotional. Who knew I was able to see Korean team to be one of top 4 teams in the world. The result of the
game was meaningless from the beginning. It was like a festival in the stadium. Every one cheered for both
teams which were Korea and Germany. Korea lost at the end but I still remember all people in the stadium
including German fans got together after the game and enjoyed the day.

My family watched a soccer game at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday. About 19,000 people came to watch the game so it was crowded with people.  
It was a match between Suwon Samsung vs. FC Seoul. The weather was so hot that I charged a portable fan and went there,
but it was so really very hot. I decided to leave five minutes early before the end of the game because I thought traffic would be
bad. When we got out of our seats and tried to get out of the exit, I was surprised and slightly annoyed because the goal was
scored. Anyway, my wife said that she watched a soccer game for the first time, and it was a good experience for my family.
