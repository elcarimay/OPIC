## 1) You indicated in your survey that you like to watch sport games. What kinds of game do you like to watch? Why do you like to watch games? When do you usually watch them? Where do you normally watch them? Who do you usually watch them with?  
```
I usually enjoy watching sports games on TV.
I used to watch a lot of basketball games, but these days, I mostly watch baseball.

Recently, I’ve been really into a show called "The Strongest Baseball", which airs every Monday night.
The show features former professional baseball players who form a new team after retirement.
Even though they’re older now, they play against high school, university, and independent league players.

Watching them is both inspiring and comforting for me.
The only downside is that the program runs from 10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., so I feel a bit tired the next morning.
Of course, I could watch the recorded version, but it just doesn’t feel the same — I prefer the excitement of watching it live.

Every Monday night, I make time for it, and while watching, I can forget all my problems and just focus on the game.
When the team or player I’m cheering for wins, it’s even better — all my stress just disappears!

## 2) Do you have any favorite player? Who is it? Why do you like him or her? What kind of sport does she or he play? Tell me about him or her in as much detail as possible.  
```
I like and respect all athletes, so picking just one is quite difficult.
But I tend to pay extra attention to athletes who are often in the media spotlight, since they are more visible to the public.

Recently, I’ve been very interested in Son Heung-min, a world-class soccer player who plays for Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League.
Although he went through very intense training from his father at a young age, he endured it all and eventually became an amazing player — now he’s not only the captain of the Korean national team, but also the captain of a Premier League team, which is especially impressive given that it's the birthplace of modern football.

One of Son’s biggest strengths is that he can use both feet equally well, which makes him extremely unpredictable to defenders.
It’s also incredibly inspiring to see an Asian player performing at such a high level, showing confidence and skill among physically strong international players.

Beyond his skills, what makes him even more admirable is his personality — for example, he once helped pay for a teammate’s surgery, and he’s always respectful and polite in interviews.
He’s not just a great athlete, but also a genuinely good person.

I really hope he continues to grow and establish himself as a legendary player, not only in Korea but around the world.
I truly wish him the best!

## 3) Do you have any memorable experience while watching the sport games? When was it? What kinds of game did you watch? Why was it so memorable to you?  
```
I must say, the most memorable experience I’ve had this year was watching a live soccer game with my family.

We went to the stadium at around 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and the match was between Suwon Samsung and FC Seoul.
There were about 19,000 people in the stadium, so it was really crowded.

The weather was extremely hot that day. I brought a charged portable fan, but it was still almost unbearable.
During halftime, the singer Park Jae-jeong, who’s really popular these days, performed his song “Let’s Say Goodbye.”
The sound quality wasn’t great because it was such a large stadium, but it was still exciting to hear him live.

What I loved the most was that, unlike watching on TV — where the camera focuses only on the ball — at the stadium,
I could see all the players' movements and the overall strategy on the field. It made cheering for the teams even more fun.

We decided to leave five minutes early to avoid traffic, but just as we were exiting, a goal was scored.
I was honestly surprised and a bit annoyed that I missed the most exciting moment.

Still, it was a great experience, especially since it was my wife’s first time watching a soccer game in person.
She said she really enjoyed it, and overall, it became a special memory for our whole family.
