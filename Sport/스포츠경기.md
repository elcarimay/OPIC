My family watched a soccer game at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday. About 19,000 people came to watch the game so it was crowded with people.  
It was a match between Suwon Samsung vs. FC Seoul. The weather was so hot that I charged a portable fan and went there,
but it was so really very hot. I decided to leave five minutes early before the end of the game because I thought traffic would be
bad. When we got out of our seats and tried to get out of the exit, I was surprised and slightly annoyed because the goal was
scored. Anyway, my wife said that she watched a soccer game for the first time, and it was a good experience for my family.
