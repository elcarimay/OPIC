## Q1) You have indicated that you like to go to the beach. Which beach do you like to go? Where is it?  What does it look like? How often do you go to this beach? How do people go there? Does it crowded?

Well.. there are the plenty of beautiful beaches in my country like Jeju island, 거제 island,  
경포대 island like that. For example, Jeju island is the biggest island in South Korea and  
Busan city is very well-known port city. It's because Korea is peninsula.  
And I'm a huge fan of the beach .. yeah because I grew up in the city. So, it's really hard  
to choose only one I like ..but if I have to do..I would say..it's Gangwon Province, which  
is 2 hours away from Seoul and it's part of the Eastern sea. Nowadays surfing is becoming  
more popular than before. Actually, it's one of the most popular surfing spots in this area  
so there are usually many people especially in the summer. Also, it's pet-friendly beach  
so I can bring my dog with me.  
In the past, it took longer to get there but since new high way was opened a couple of years  
ago, it takes only 2 hours. I mean without traffic and I usually go there once a month in the  
summer and chill out. For the last, there is really famous burger place, which is called as  
"Farmers Burger". I never forget to stop by that place whenever I go there. I don't wanna  
miss out any fun things. Yeah, that's all about my favorite beach.
