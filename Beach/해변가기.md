## Q1) You have indicated that you like to go to the beach. Which beach do you like to go? Where is it?  What does it look like? How often do you go to this beach? How do people go there? Does it crowded?
```
Well.. there are the plenty of beautiful beaches in my country like Jeju island, 거제 island,  
경포대 island like that. For example, Jeju island is the biggest island in South Korea and  
Busan city is very well-known port city. It's because Korea is peninsula.  
And I'm a huge fan of the beach .. yeah because I grew up in the city. So, it's really hard  
to choose only one I like ..but if I have to do..I would say..it's Gangwon Province, which  
is 2 hours away from Seoul and it's part of the Eastern sea. Nowadays surfing is becoming  
more popular than before. Actually, it's one of the most popular surfing spots in this area  
so there are usually many people especially in the summer. Also, it's pet-friendly beach  
so I can bring my dog with me.  
In the past, it took longer to get there but since new high way was opened a couple of years  
ago, it takes only 2 hours. I mean without traffic and I usually go there once a month in the  
summer and chill out. For the last, there is really famous burger place, which is called as  
"Farmers Burger". I never forget to stop by that place whenever I go there. I don't wanna  
miss out any fun things. Yeah, that's all about my favorite beach.
```
## Q2) When do you go to the beach? What do you usually do there? Who do you go with? Tell me everything you know about activities at the beach.
```
Well.. things I do at the beach~ when I go to the beach, the first thing I do is finding  
perfect spot. Where I can put up my tent to relax or have fun ..  
1) And actually I'm a huge fan of the beach .. so I like to swim in the ocean and enjoy  
the waves. My kids also love it so. I swim with my kids in the water. We splash water.  
2) And actually I'm not a huge fan of the beach so I'm not a good swimmer but I like to  
see people while drinking beer on the beach and it's actually really fun.  
3) And actually I'm not huge fan of the beach but I go to the beach because of my kids,  
but I don't like to swim and get tanned so I usually stay under the tent and sit on the  
camp chair and watch them.  
Afeter few hours, my kids and I get exhausted so after taking a shower and we get ready  
to eat. Actually, there is really famous burger restaurant "Farmers Kitchen". I believe  
they serve the best one in town so I never forget to stop by that place whenever I go  
there. I think that's pretty much what I do at the beach.
```
## Q3) Tell me about the beach that you went to recently. What did it look like? What did you like about that beach? Describe it detail.
```
Hmm, the beach I went to the beach called "제부 island". The beach is actually not that  
far from where I live / my place. Yeah .. it's like less than an hour. so it's pretty  
easy to get there. I went there to have some seafood for my wife's birthday(dinner).  
Because there is her favorite seafood restaurant on the top of that, the view of coastline  
is very scenic. So we went there to have some sashimi and drinks. When we arrived, that  
place was pretty packed since it's a very famous. Anyway, we waited in line for about 20  
minutes to get in and could get a table. We went there around 6 so we could enjoy  
beautiful sunset also. After dinner, we walked around the seashore. Actually, I'm really  
busy at work during the weekdays so I really have spare time to spend with her.  
But I took a half day off to surprise her so we could have a great time together.  
She was very happy and I was very proud of myself. Yeah, that's my recent experience at the  
beach. Yeah, that's all about it.
