## Q1) You have indicated that you like to go to the beach. Which beach do you like to go? Where is it?  What does it look like? How often do you go to this beach? How do people go there? Does it crowded?
```
Well.. there are the plenty of beautiful beaches in my country like Jeju island, 거제 island,  
경포대 island like that. For example, Jeju island is the biggest island in South Korea and  
Busan city is very well-known port city. It's because Korea is peninsula.  
And I'm a huge fan of the beach .. yeah because I grew up in the city. So, it's really hard  
to choose only one I like ..but if I have to do..I would say..it's Gangwon Province, which  
is 2 hours away from Dongtan and it's part of the Eastern sea. Nowadays surfing is becoming  
more popular than before. Actually, it's one of the most popular surfing spots in this area  
so there are usually many people especially in the summer.  
In the past, it took longer to get there but since new high way was opened a couple of years  
ago, it takes only 2 hours. I usually go there once a month in the summer and chill out.
(긴장을 풀다.) Yeah, that's all about my favorite beach.
```
## Q2) When do you go to the beach? What do you usually do there? Who do you go with? Tell me everything you know about activities at the beach.
```
Well.. things I do at the beach~ when I go to the beach, the first thing I do is finding  
perfect spot. Where I can put up my tent to relax or have fun ..  
And actually I'm a huge fan of the beach .. so I like to swim in the ocean and enjoy  
the waves. My kids also love it so. I swim with my kids in the water. We splash water.
And I usually take a lot of pictures of my family. So I take a smparphone and a spare battery.
The reason why I go to the beach is that it's one of the best way for me to relieve stress.  
I think that's pretty much what I do at the beach.
```
## Q3) Tell me about the beach that you went to recently. What did it look like? What did you like about that beach? Describe it detail.
```
Hmm, the beach I went to the beach called "제부 island". The beach is actually not that  
far from my place. Yeah .. it took about an hour and a half. I went there to have some
seafood. Because there is my favorite seafood restaurant on the top of that, the view of
coastline is very scenic. So we went there to have some sashimi and drinks. When we arrived, that  
place was pretty packed since it's a very famous. Anyway, we waited in line for about 20  
minutes to get in and could get a table. We went there around 6 pm. so we could enjoy  
beautiful sunset also. After dinner, we walked around the seashore. Actually, I'm really  
busy at work during the weekdays.. so I really wanted to have spare time to spend with my family.  
My family was very happy and I was very proud of myself. Yeah, that's my recent experience at the  
beach.
```
## Q4) Tell me about a particularly memorable trip to the beach. Who were you with? Which beach were you at? What did you do there? What made this trip to the beach more memorable of special? Tell me everything yo did from the moment you arrived there.
```
I remember going to the beach with my family during the holidays called 추석 which is kind of  
Korean thanksgiving. We had planning to go camping and booked the closest camping site to the beach.
After arriving at the camping site in Inje, unpack and set up a tent. After that, we went
to the beach on the East cost. Although my son couldn't swim because the water temperature
was a little low, he had fun picking up clams and catching small crabs between rocks.
The beach was very peaceful and lovely. We took a lot of pictures including selfies.
A few hours later, we were hungry and searched for good restaurants and ate seafood and it was
very delicious. After that, we came back to the camping site and had a campfire and had a great
time. It was very special because we experienced camping and the beach together. I got lots of
awesome pictures from that trip!! Yeah, that's why this trip was so memorable/special.
