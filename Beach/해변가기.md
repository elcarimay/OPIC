## Q1) You have indicated that you like to go to the beach. Which beach do you like to go? Where is it?  What does it look like? How often do you go to this beach? How do people go there? Does it crowded?
```
Well, there are plenty of beautiful beaches in my country, like Jeju Island, Geoje Island, and Gyeongpo Beach, just to name a few.
For example, Jeju Island is the biggest island in South Korea, and Busan is a very well-known port city. That makes sense because Korea is a peninsula.

I’m a huge fan of beaches, so it’s really hard to choose just one.
But if I had to pick, I’d say my favorite is Gangwon Province, which is about two hours away from Dongtan.
It’s on the eastern coast of Korea, and these days, surfing has become much more popular than before.
Jukdo Beach is one of the most popular surfing spots in that area.
I went there recently and saw many people learning how to surf with instructors.

I don’t know how to surf myself, but I think a lot of people are interested in it.
In the past, it used to take longer to get there, but since a new highway opened a couple of years ago, it only takes about two hours now.
I usually go there once a month during the summer to relax and chill out.

That’s all about my favorite beach.
```
## Q2) When do you go to the beach? What do you usually do there? Who do you go with? Tell me everything you know about activities at the beach.
```
Well, when I go to the beach, the first thing I usually do is find the perfect spot where I can set up my tent and relax or have some fun.
Actually, I’m a huge fan of the beach, so I really enjoy playing in the ocean with a tube and riding the waves.
My kids love it too, so we have a great time together.

I always bring my smartphone and a waterproof bag so I can take lots of pictures of my family.
It’s one of the best ways for me to make memories and also to relax.

The main reason I go to the beach is because it’s one of the best ways for me to relieve stress.
I always feel refreshed and happy after spending time there.

So, yeah, that’s pretty much what I usually do at the beach.
```
## Q3) Tell me about the beach that you went to recently. What did it look like? What did you like about that beach? Describe it detail.
```
Hmm, the beach I went to recently was called Jebu Island.
It’s actually not that far from my place — it took about an hour and a half to get there.
I went there to enjoy some seafood because my favorite seafood restaurant is located there.
On top of that, the view of the coastline is really scenic, so we went to have some sashimi and drinks.

When we arrived, the place was pretty packed since it’s quite famous.
Anyway, we waited in line for about 20 minutes and then got a table.
We went there around 6 p.m., so we were also able to enjoy the beautiful sunset.
After dinner, we took a walk along the seashore.

Actually, I’ve been really busy with work during the weekdays, so I really wanted to have some quality time with my family.
My family was very happy, and I felt proud of myself for planning that trip.
That was my recent experience at the beach.
```
## Q4) Tell me about a particularly memorable trip to the beach. Who were you with? Which beach were you at? What did you do there? What made this trip to the beach more memorable of special? Tell me everything yo did from the moment you arrived there.
```
I remember going to the beach with my family during the Chuseok holidays, which is kind of like Korean Thanksgiving.
We had planned to go camping, so we booked a campsite near the beach.

After arriving at the campsite in Inje, we unpacked and set up our tent.
Then, we went to a beach on the east coast.
Although my son couldn’t swim because the water was a bit cold, he still had a lot of fun picking up clams and catching small crabs between the rocks.

The beach was very peaceful and beautiful. We took lots of pictures, including some selfies.
After a few hours, we started to feel hungry, so we searched for a good restaurant and had some delicious seafood.

Later, we came back to the campsite, had a campfire, and enjoyed a great evening together.
It was really special because we got to experience both camping and the beach on the same trip.
I also got so many awesome photos from that day!

Yeah, that’s why this trip was such a memorable and meaningful experience for me.
