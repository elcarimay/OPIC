## What do people in your country do in their free time? How do they spend their free time?
```
First, Many people spend their free time watching TV dramas, movies or variety shows.
It is so common that it is called the era of one-person, one-family television, and it is
so close to us that the house is awkward if it is not turned on rather than because we
want to see it. It's good to spend your free time just watching without doing anything.
I think it's not only Koreans, but also many people of the all other countries.
Secondly, surfing the Internet. Not only is Korea's Internet speed one of the best in the
world, but the environment and electronic devices for Internet access are also common.
The most representative thing is the computer and smartphone in my hand. The reality is
that most of them rely on smartphones in a short period of time.
Thirdly, With the rise of e-sports, playing video games has become a popular hobby in Korea.
Many people enjoy playing games on their computer or mobile devices, either alone or with friends.
It is known as a country that is good at games around the world, and the PC room culture is
better than any other country, making it an essential experience course for foreigners who come to tour.
Fourthly, Koreans place a high value on health and fitness, so many people use their free time to exercise.
Visiting a nearby park and taking a walk near your house is also a hobby that many Koreans do.
The fifth is listening to music. Due to the global export of K-pop, the music industry has also
developed, and it is easy to see people listening to music while wearing earphones in their daily lives.
I always watch YouTube with earphones on the bus to work.
Eventually, Spending time with friends and family is an important part of Korean culture.
People might meet up for a meal, go to a cafe, or participate in group activities like hiking or sports.

## Tell me about the last time you had some free time. When was it? What did you do?
```
I had been busy with work during the week, so I was looking forward to a chance to relax and do something fun.
Last Saturday morning, I slept a little bit and then had a relaxed breakfast at home. Afterward,
I decided to go for a walk in a nearby park to enjoy the fresh air and exercise. While I was there,
I played basketball with my son. It's good to relieve the sorry that I can't play with you on weekdays
on weekends. My son, who always has enough stamina, exercises longer than me. After exercising for about
two hours, I went home, took a shower, took a short break, had dinner together, and watched TV.
These days, even if it is not a regular broadcast, there are so many kinds of videos on YouTube at any time.
We usually watch entertainment programs, and an hour or two passes really quickly.
Overall, I enjoyed a relaxing weekend with a lot of activities and time.

## How did you spend your free time when you were a child? What did you do?
```
I used to live in a low apartment when I was young, but there was a playground made of sand nearby, and there
were always many children there. They hung on iron bars, built sand castles to play, and played with sand
while being thick. I used to play soccer in elementary school. I usually defended, but it was so fun to
intercept the attacking children's balls and pass them to our side. When I was in middle and high school,
I used to play basketball with my younger brother or friends. Basketball is an exercise that requires skills
unexpectedly, so after doing it to some extent, I can gain confidence and build up my skills. I loved it.
Some friend might have taken up hobbies like playing a musical instrument, drawing or painting, or practicing a martial art.
They might have attended lessons or classes to improve their skills in these areas.
I also spend time with my family, going on a trip or participating in various activities often. For example, I might have
gone on a picnic, visited a museum or cultural site, or watched a movie together.
Overall, while I was facing academic pressure, I also had plenty of opportunities for fun and creative activities in my free time.
