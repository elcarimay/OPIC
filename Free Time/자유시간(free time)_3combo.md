## What do people in your country do in their free time? How do they spend their free time?
```
First, many people in Korea spend their free time watching TV dramas, movies, or variety shows.
It’s such a common habit that people often refer to it as the era of “one person, one TV.”
These days, the TV is always on at home — not necessarily because people want to watch something,
but because it feels strange when it’s off.
Sometimes, it’s nice to just relax and watch something without doing anything else.
And I think this isn’t only true for Koreans, but for people in many countries around the world.

Second, surfing the internet is extremely popular.
Korea is known for having some of the fastest internet speeds in the world, and internet access is very convenient.
People use a wide range of devices like computers and smartphones, and these days, most people rely heavily on their phones even for short periods of time.

Third, playing video games has become a huge hobby, especially with the rise of e-sports.
Many people enjoy gaming on their computers or mobile phones, whether alone or with friends.
Korea is well-known globally for its strong gaming culture, and PC rooms (internet cafes) are more advanced than in most other countries.
In fact, visiting a PC room has even become a must-try experience for some foreign tourists.

Fourth, health and fitness are also important to many Koreans.
A lot of people spend their free time exercising, whether at the gym or simply by taking a walk in a nearby park.
Walking around the neighborhood is a common and easy way to stay healthy.

Fifth, listening to music is a big part of daily life in Korea, especially with the global popularity of K-pop.
It’s common to see people wearing earphones and enjoying music while walking or commuting.
Personally, I always watch YouTube videos with my earphones on the bus to work.

Lastly, spending time with friends and family is an essential part of Korean culture.
People often meet up for meals, hang out at cafés, or enjoy group activities like hiking or playing sports.

## Tell me about the last time you had some free time. When was it? What did you do?
```
I had been really busy with work during the week, so I was looking forward to relaxing and doing something fun.
On Saturday morning, I slept in a little and had a relaxed breakfast at home.
After that, I decided to go for a walk in a nearby park to enjoy the fresh air and get some light exercise.

While I was at the park, I played basketball with my son.
On weekdays, I often feel sorry that I don’t have much time to play with him, so I try to make up for it on weekends.
My son has endless energy, so he always exercises longer than I do!

After about two hours of exercise, we went back home.
I took a shower, had a short break, and then we had dinner together and watched TV.
These days, even if there’s nothing interesting on regular channels, there are so many fun videos on YouTube to choose from.
We usually enjoy watching entertainment programs, and time flies — one or two hours pass really quickly.

Overall, I had a relaxing but active weekend and spent some meaningful time with my family.

## How did you spend your free time when you were a child? What did you do?
```
When I was young, I used to live in a low-rise apartment, and there was a sand playground nearby.
It was always filled with children. We would hang on iron bars, build sandcastles, and play in the sand together.

In elementary school, I often played soccer. I usually played as a defender, and I really enjoyed intercepting the ball from the other team and passing it to my teammates.
It was simple, but really fun.

Later, when I was in middle and high school, I started playing basketball with my younger brother or friends.
Basketball is a sport that surprisingly requires a lot of skill, and the more I played, the more confident I became.
I loved practicing and improving my game over time.

Some of my friends had different hobbies, like playing musical instruments, drawing, painting, or practicing martial arts.
They even took lessons or classes to improve their skills in those areas.

I also spent a lot of time with my family. We often went on trips or did various activities together —
for example, going on a picnic, visiting museums or cultural sites, or watching movies.

Overall, even though I had academic pressure, I was lucky to have plenty of opportunities to enjoy fun and creative activities in my free time.
