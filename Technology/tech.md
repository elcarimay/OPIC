## 1. What kind of technology do student use in school these days? What is it? What is it used for? Please tell me about it in as much detail you can.
```
There are various technologies used in school nowadays. The technology of computerized devices and
internet is commonly used from the beginning of the school life. Students can register their courses online
unlike before when students had to call or submit written forms to register classes or courses. When a term or
a semester starts students see more technologies used in their lives. Students’ ID card which should be used to
open the door of the school building preventing random people from entering the building is issued. It is also
used to enter the library as well as reserve the seat there. In the class, white or black boards are placed but
rarely used. Instead, a computer is connected to a screen in each class room for students’ and professors’
convenience. There is a special white board in my school that can print whatever is written on the board by
pushing a button so students do not have to take a note. Reports and term papers are submitted to the main
server of the school which makes impossible to hand in late-paper. Due to such technologies, students as well as professors
are able to enjoy convenient school lives.

## 2. What kinds of technology do you think is used in daily life? What technology do you enjoy most frequently? Why do you think you use that technology?
```
Of the technologies that people use every day, the most commonly used one is a smart phone. It is the
extract of advanced technologies we use frequently. We are able to give and receive a call which is the basic
use of it. We can use it as a computer with an access to internet. Visiting websites, checking email, and
searching information we want can be done with a smart phone. In addition, it can be used as a digital camera. It even has more advanced
functions than a digital camera found in retail shops such as editing pictures and movies right on the phone. A
smart phone can be used as an entertainment station. When it comes to listening to music, it can be used as
an MP3 player. It also offers various video and computer games. Lastly it contains a navigation technology to
help people find the right roads to get their final destination. There are more technologies found in a smart
phone. As mentioned, I think it is the device that several technologies were put into and that is why a number
of people use it.

## 3. Could you describe how technology has changed from the past to the present? Do you think it has been developed in a better way? Tell me about changes in technologies you use.
```
I am not an expert to describe how technology has changed in detail but I can tell distinctive changes that
have been made in people’s lives in various fields. It is clear that the advance in technology helps enjoy lives in
much more convenient ways. First of all in communication, a few years ago, wired telephone and hand written
letters were pretty much everything we used to communicate with others. As the technology in a computer,
internet and a smart phone has developed, we are able to keep in touch with others consistently. In terms of
entertainment, people used to enjoy listening to music with their cassette tapes and CDs but no one actually
carries devices to play such media nowadays. Instead, cell phone has every function needed to enjoy music
because now we can listen to music in electrical forms. In the field of transportation, due to the advance
of technology in public transportation, we can not only go anywhere we want
but also have an access of products from other countries with relatively reasonable price. Advance in
technologies in various fields has made our lives more convenient so I do believe it has developed and will
develop in a better way.
