## 1. What kind of technology do student use in school these days? What is it? What is it used for? Please tell me about it in as much detail you can.
```
These days, there are various technologies being used in schools, and they’ve become an important part of student life.
From the beginning of the school year, students use computerized systems and the internet for many tasks.

For example, students can register for their courses online, unlike in the past when they had to submit forms by hand or make phone calls.
Once the semester begins, even more technology is involved in daily school life.

Students are issued an ID card, which they use to enter school buildings — this helps prevent strangers from coming in.
The same card is also used to access the library and reserve study seats.

In the classroom, traditional whiteboards or blackboards still exist, but they’re rarely used.
Instead, a computer is connected to a projector or screen in almost every room for the convenience of both students and professors.

There’s even a special type of whiteboard at my school that can print whatever is written on it with the push of a button,
so students don’t have to take notes by hand.

Also, assignments and term papers are submitted directly to the school’s main server, which prevents late submissions.

Thanks to these technologies, school life has become much more convenient for both students and teachers.

## 2. What kinds of technology do you think is used in daily life? What technology do you enjoy most frequently? Why do you think you use that technology?
```
Among the technologies people use every day, I think the most commonly used one is the smartphone.
It’s the perfect example of how advanced technologies are integrated into one device, and we use it constantly.

Of course, its most basic function is to make and receive calls, but that’s just the beginning.
With access to the internet, a smartphone can be used almost like a mini computer.
We can browse websites, check emails, and search for information anytime and anywhere.

In addition, it functions as a digital camera, and in many cases, it has even more advanced features than traditional cameras.
We can edit photos and videos directly on the phone, which makes it very convenient.

A smartphone also serves as an entertainment center.
We can listen to music like an MP3 player, watch videos, or even play mobile games.
It also includes navigation technology, helping people find directions and get to their destination without getting lost.

There are so many technologies built into a smartphone, and that’s exactly why it has become an essential device for most people.
It combines multiple tools in one, making our daily lives easier and more efficient.

## 3. Could you describe how technology has changed from the past to the present? Do you think it has been developed in a better way? Tell me about changes in technologies you use.
```
I'm not an expert when it comes to explaining how technology has changed in detail, but I can definitely talk about some major changes it has brought to our daily lives in various areas.

First of all, technology has made our lives much more convenient and efficient.
In the field of communication, just a few years ago, people mainly used landline phones or handwritten letters to stay in touch.
But with the development of computers, the internet, and smartphones, we can now communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, through calls, texts, emails, and even video chats.

When it comes to entertainment, people used to listen to music with cassette tapes and CDs.
Today, no one carries those devices anymore because smartphones can do everything — we can listen to music in digital formats through apps and streaming services.

In the area of transportation, technology has also had a huge impact.
Not only can we travel more comfortably and efficiently, but we also have access to products from other countries at reasonable prices, thanks to global shipping systems and advanced logistics.

Overall, I believe that advances in technology have made our lives easier in so many ways.
It has already changed the world a lot, and I’m sure it will continue to develop in even better ways in the future.
