## Q1) You indicated that you go to cafes of coffee shops. Describe what the coffee shop you go to often looks like. What is special about that place?  
```
There are tons of bars and pubs in Korea. Actually, they are all over the places.  
And most of them are on busy streets with a lot of traffic.
Most coffee shops are major franchise coffee shops like Starbucks, mega coffee,
ediya, compose coffee, Baek dabang. In fact, I don't go to many coffee shops
because I usually enjoying hand drip coffee, but there are coffee shops that
I sometimes go to. It's a local coffee shop and it takes about 15 minutes by walk.
It's very small and cozy place, so it never gets crowded. Also, the place roast 
their coffee. So they always serve best one in town. The problem is that the
coffee tastes good, but the boss's hands are too slow. It takes at least 20
minutes to make coffee. It may be annoying, but I don't have any complaints
because the coffee tastes good. On the contrary, it seems that I can relax
and the impatience disappears.

## Q2) How have coffee shops changed over the years? How were they in the past and how are they now? Is there anything special about them today?  
```
Changes in coffee shops? well, there are lots of changes in coffee shop. As I remember,  
big Franchise coffee shops were more popular than small ones. For example, Starbucks  
is still the most popular but is was much more popular in the past. Whenever people  
thought about coffee, they go to get brand coffee shops rather than local ones.  
Nowadays, more people want to find a small and better coffee shops. Because big franchise  
coffee is usually pricy so some people think it's not worth of money. Also, this helps  
small business coffee shop owners. while franchise coffee shop always provide same menu  
everywhere, local ones have their own menu like hand drip coffee or famous dessert.  
There are special because people can't try them everywhere. Also, local small coffee  
shops usually serve better quality of coffee on the top of that, it's usually less crowded  
and cozy. Yeah, I think there are some changes in coffee shop over the years.

## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident that happened at a coffee shop. What happened?
Who was involved? How did you deal with that situation? Tell me everything about what  
happened from beginning to end.  
```
A memorable incident at a coffee shop.. well.. I think.. Yeah, this is what happened. It  
happened at coffee shop drive thru.. You know.. Drive-thru is still a new thing in Korea  
because there are not many places to provide this kind of services and I was also not  
familiar with this. Anyway, last summer, I wanted to have caramel macchiato and some  
cheese cake so I went to Starbucks drive-thru and got coffee to go. After I ordered, I  
paid with my card and after few minutes, I got my treats and I just left that spot.  
Starbucks stuff followed my car to get me a coffee. So I had to go back to the coffee
shop, I had to drive all the way and it took about 20 minutes, because traffic was
really bad. Finally, I could get my destination on time. But it was my fault.
Anyway, since then, every time I order coffee at drive thru, I double check if I have
everything. It was my memorable experience at the coffee shop.
