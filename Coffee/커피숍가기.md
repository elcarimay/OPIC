## Q1) You indicated that you go to cafes of coffee shops. Describe what the coffee shop you go to often looks like. What is special about that place?  
```
There are tons of bars and pubs in Korea — actually, they’re everywhere.
Most of them are located on busy streets with lots of traffic and people.

When it comes to coffee shops, most are major franchises like Starbucks, Mega Coffee, Ediya, Compose Coffee, and Baek Dabang.
To be honest, I don’t go to coffee shops very often because I usually enjoy hand-drip coffee at home.
But there’s one local coffee shop I visit from time to time. It’s about a 15-minute walk from my place.

The shop is small and cozy, so it’s never crowded. One thing I really like is that they roast their own beans, so the coffee is always fresh and delicious.
Honestly, I think it’s the best coffee in town.

The only downside is that the owner is a bit slow when making coffee.
It usually takes at least 20 minutes to get my drink.
Some people might find that annoying, but I don’t really mind — because the coffee tastes so good.
Actually, I feel like the slow pace helps me relax, and my impatience just fades away.
```
## Q2) How have coffee shops changed over the years? How were they in the past and how are they now? Is there anything special about them today?  
```
Changes in coffee shops? Well, I think there have been a lot of changes over the years.
As I remember, big franchise coffee shops used to be much more popular than small local ones.
For example, Starbucks is still very popular, but it was even more dominant in the past.
Whenever people thought about coffee, they would usually go to a well-known brand rather than a local café.

But these days, more people are looking for small, high-quality coffee shops.
Franchise coffee is often expensive, and some people feel it’s not really worth the money.
So now, many customers prefer to support small, independent cafés.

One difference is that franchise coffee shops always have the same menu, no matter where you go.
On the other hand, local cafés often have unique menus — like hand-drip coffee or special desserts —
so you can enjoy something you can’t find anywhere else.

Also, local cafés usually offer better quality coffee, and they’re often less crowded and more cozy.
So yeah, I think coffee shop culture has definitely changed in recent years.

## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident that happened at a coffee shop. What happened? Who was involved? How did you deal with that situation? Tell me everything about what happened from beginning to end.  
```
A memorable incident at a coffee shop? Well... yeah, I’ve got one.
It happened at a drive-thru coffee shop, actually. You know, drive-thrus are still kind of new in Korea because not many places offer that service, and honestly, I wasn’t very familiar with how it worked either.

Anyway, last summer, I was craving a caramel macchiato and a slice of cheesecake, so I went to a Starbucks drive-thru to grab some treats.
I placed my order, paid with my card, and after a few minutes, they handed me the food — or so I thought.
I just drove off right after that.

But then, a Starbucks staff member came running after my car holding the drink!
Turns out, I had forgotten to take my coffee.
I had already left the area, and the traffic was terrible, so I had to make a full circle back.
It took me almost 20 minutes to return and pick up my drink.
Luckily, I still made it to my destination on time, but it was definitely my mistake.

Since then, whenever I go to a drive-thru, I always double-check to make sure I got everything before leaving.
That was a funny and memorable coffee shop experience I won’t forget!
