## Q1) You indicated that you go to cafes of coffee shops. Describe what the coffee shop you go to  
often looks like. What is special about that place?  
```
There are tons of bars and pubs in Korea. Actually, they are all over the places.  
And most of them are located around subway station or college town. / Most of them  
are on busy streets with a lot of traffic. Anyway, let me tell you one of the coffeeshop  
where I usually go to. Personally, I like to go to cafe near my office / place.  
It's a local coffee shop that serves hand drip coffee. I like going there because  
I like the food and atmosphere. And I really like to going to a Korean style cafe  
where I can have some Korean tea. It's not too far from where I live, so I usually go  
there when I went to be lazy and do nothing or stressed out. And actually, I'm a regular  
there. I also like to go there from time to time because I like the coffee they serve.  
They serve one of the best cake which is my favorite dessert to drink with. Somtimes, I  
go there by myself because I like to grab some drinks at the end of the long day. It's  
a great place to have some drinks, so I recommend you to go there if you have a chance.
```
```
Coffee shops? Yeah. I'm a big fan of coffee / I'm a coffee person!  
And there are plenty of coffee shops in Korea. I heard Korea is one of the top 5 coffee  
consuming countries. Anyway, most coffee shops are major franchise coffee shops from  
overseas like Starbucks and Coffee beans. Also, we have Korean brand coffee shops like  
Cafe Bene, Angel-in-us things like that. There are so many different kinds of coffee  
shops to choose from ...  
Anyway, one of the coffee shop where I usually go to is just a local coffee shop. It's  
not that far from my home. I think it takes about 15 minutes by walk. It's a very small  
and cozy place, so it never gets crowded. Also, the place roast their own coffee. So  
they always serve best one in town. Actually, I'm a regular there, so I usually go there  
on weekends. You know.. as I go there quite often .. I'm quite close with coffee shop  
manager. So, she knew my coffee tastes very well. This place is so special because I  
have learned lots of things about coffee from her. Yeah, that's all about the coffee  
shop I usually go to.
```
## Q2) What do you usually go when you go to coffee shops? Do you have meetings or  
gatherings there? Tell you what you like to do.  
```
The coffee shop I usually go to? As I told you, it's only 15 minutes walk from my place.  
So I usually go there whenever I want to kill time with my friend as I use internet or  
do some work. I think working at cafe is quite efficient so I really like to be there  
and finish my work. And I usually go there by myself because I like to be alone.  
Actually, there are only 3 tables in that coffee shop, so most people just get coffee  
to go. So usually I'm the only customers sitting on the table. And when the coffee shop  
manager is not too busy, she likes to make me hand drip coffee with some dessert.  
Sometimes, we grab some bites together and it usually tastes good. Yeah, this is what  
I usually do at the coffee shop.
```
## Q3) How have coffee shops changed over the years? How were they in the past and how  
are they now? Is there anything special about them today?  
```
Changes in coffee shops? well, there are lots of changes in coffee shop. As I remember,  
big Franchise coffee shops were more popular than small ones. For example, Starbucks  
is still the most popular but is was much more popular in the past. Whenever people  
thought about coffee, they go to get brand coffee shops rather than local ones.  
Nowadays, more people want to find a small and better coffee shops. Because big franchise  
coffee is usually pricy so some people think it's not worth of money. Also, this helps  
small business coffee shop owners. while franchise coffee shop always provide same menu  
everywhere, local ones have their own menu like hand drip coffee or famous dessert.  
There are special because people can't try them everywhere. Also, local small coffee  
shops usually serve better quality of coffee on the top of that, it's usually less crowded  
and cozy. Yeah, I think there are some changes in coffee shop over the years.
```
## Q4) Tell me about a memorable incident that happened at a coffee shop. What happened?
Who was involved? How did you deal with that situation? Tell me everything about what  
happened from beginning to end.  
```
A memorable incident at a coffee shop.. well.. I think.. Yeah, this is what happened. It  
happened at coffee shop drive thru.. You know.. Drive-thru is still a new thing in Korea  
because there are not many places to provide this kind of services and I was also not  
familiar with this. Anyway, last summer, I wanted to have caramel macchiato and some  
cheese cake so I went to Starbucks drive-thru and got coffee to go. After I ordered, I  
paid with my card and after few minutes. I got my treats and I just left that spot.  
Starbucks employee / stuff followed my car to get me a coffee and when I saw him, it was  
too late. So to go back to the coffee shop, I had to drive all the way and it took about  
20 minutes, because traffic was really bad. Finally, I could get my coffee. But it was  
too cold but it was my fault. Anyway, since then, every time I order coffee at drive  
thru, I double check if I have everything. It was my memorable experience at the coffee  
shop.
