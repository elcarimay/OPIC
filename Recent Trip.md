# Do you remember recent trip? What did you do? What was the special thing in your trip?
```
I went to Saipan, a small island in the western Pacific Ocean. During your trip,
I enjoyed the beautiful beaches and crystal clear waters, going snorkeling to
explore the colorful underwater world in island of Managaha. I also visited some
historic sites, such as World War II battlefields and memorials.

The most special thing about my trip was the opportunity to witness a lot of starlights.
I lay down on a mat and watched it with my family. I felt like stars were pouring down.
I was impressed by the beautiful scenary. And I felt grateful to be with my family.
