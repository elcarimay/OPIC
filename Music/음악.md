## Q1) You indicated that you like to listen to music. What type of music do you like listening to? Plus,who is your favorite singer or composer? What is special about his or her music?  
These days, I enjoy Korean pop music the most.
When I listen to K-pop, I can really feel my stress melt away.

My favorite singer is Im Han-byul. He’s really popular these days, and he has a natural talent for hitting high notes.
His voice is so emotional and powerful, and I enjoy listening to his songs when I need a break.

I also enjoy classical music, especially symphonies that are performed with many different instruments.
Two of my favorite pieces are Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 "Choral" and Mozart’s Symphony No. 41 "Jupiter."
Even when you turn up the volume, classical music doesn’t feel loud or overwhelming.
It helps me calm down and relax after a busy day.

## Q2) When and where do you like to listen to music? Why do you listen to music?  
I like to listen to music when I’m on the move.
Since I always have my phone with me, I can listen to music wherever I am.

In the morning, after getting off the shuttle bus, I usually listen to music on my walk to the office.
It takes about 10 minutes, so I plug in my earphones and enjoy a few songs.
Listening to music during that time makes my steps feel lighter and helps me start the day with a good mood.

I also enjoy listening to music in the car when I’m driving.
It’s a great way to kill time and keep myself relaxed while on the road.

Overall, I listen to music almost every day, whenever I feel like it.
It’s become a regular part of my daily routine.

## Q3) What kind of music did you listen to when you were young? How was that music different from the music you listen to today? How has your interest in music changed over the years?  
I used to listen to classical music when I was younger.
At that time, I would look up the background and history of each piece through books, and I downloaded music files from the internet to listen to them.

These days, I usually listen to the latest songs, especially through YouTube, which is constantly updated with new music, so I never get bored.
When I listen to classical music, I feel calm and relaxed, but the Korean pop songs I enjoy now are more upbeat and exciting.

In the past, I used to believe that only classical music was “high-quality” music.
But as I get older, I’ve come to realize that good music is the kind you can relate to emotionally, no matter the genre.

## Q4) Tell me about an unpleasant incident you had related to music. What was the problem? What exactly happened? How did you deal with the situation? Give me all the details from beginning to end.

I used to make a list of classical music, organized by composer.
One day, my computer broke down and the entire list was erased.
It was really difficult to start over, especially because I had more than 3,000 music files, and sorting them one by one was a huge task.

It ended up becoming a long-term project for me.
I was able to sort about 100 files a day, and it took me around a month to finish reorganizing everything.
Since then, I’ve made it a habit to always back up my music file lists on a USB drive, just in case something like that happens again.

That’s one of my most memorable experiences related to music.
