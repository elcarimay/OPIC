## Q1) You indicated that you like to listen to music. What type of music do you like listening to? Plus,who is your favorite singer or composer? What is special about his or her music?  
Nowadays, I like Korean pop music the best. When I listen to Korean pop songs, I can feel the stress melting away.
My favorite singer is im-han-byul. The singer is hot there days. He has an inborn talent in the high-pitched voice.
And One of my favorite songs is Classic. I especially like symponies which is made by many musical instruments. 
Beethoven No. 9 "Choral" and Mozart No. 41 "jupyter" are my favorite songs in Classic. 
It's not loud even if you turn up the volume of classical music. Classical music calms me down and relaxes me.

## Q2) When and where do you like to listen to music? Why do you listen to music?  
I like to listen  to music when I'm on the move. Since I always have my cell phone, I listen to music wherever I am. In the morning,
I get off the shuttle bus and listen to music on my way to work. It takes about 10 minutes to get to my office so, I plug in my earphones.
Walking to the office makes my steps lighter.
And I also listen to music in my car when I'm driving. It also is a good way to kill time.
Overall, I listen to music almost every day whenever I want.

## Q3) What kind of music did you listen to when you were young? How was that music different from the music you listen to today? How has your interest in music changed over the years?  
I usually listened to classical music when I was young. First, I searched the background or related knowledge of music through books, And
I downloaded music files on the Internet and listened to them.
Currently, I usually listen to the latest songs, but I am not bored because I listen to new music because it is constantly updated with YouTube.
When I listen to old classical music, I feel calm, but the Korean pop songs I listen to these days is exciting.
In the past, I thought only classical music was high-quality music, but as I get older, I think that music that I can relate to
is good music.
