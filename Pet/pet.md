1. You indicated in your survey you have a pet. I would like to know why you have a pet. Are there any benefits?
Please tell me about it in detail.

Before I have my own pet I did not know what it means to have a pet. I thought it would be easy to have a
pet just like things I have in my room. However, it is totally different from what I expected. Having a pet takes
enormous responsibility just like having a child but at the same time gives me more rewarding than any other
things I have. 

 Actually I decided to have a pet because I was lonely. I thought a pet could be an easy solution.
At first I had to take care of it. Clean after it, wash it, take it to the vet and play with it. It needed more work
than I expected. But a couple of years later, my pet gives me much more than what I gave to it. It comforts me
when I feel blue; surprisingly it always knows when I feel under the weather. It comes to greet me first, cries out
loud whenever I have to leave the house, and tries to protect me. This is why I have a pet. It feels like a family. I have never regretted having a pet so far.


2. Do you remember the first time you got your pet? How did you feel when you first saw it? How did you get it?

One day, my wife sent me a very cute picture on Kakaotalk, but I didn't know what kind of animal it was. It was
 amazing and curious because it was the first animal I've ever seen. When I searched, Crested Gekko was a small animal
 that lived on an island called New Caledonia, but it was an endangered species in the region, so it was rarely in
 nature and was preserved as people took it and raised it. It was so cute that I decided to bring it, went to a nearby
 reptile shop, and met many people. In particular, I received a lot of help from Naver Cafe, and transactions between
 individuals were active. So at first, it was sold through personal transactions. It was a morph called Red Lily, and
 red and white were harmonized and small and cute. It was so fast that my son named it Speed, but at the end of last
 year, he sent it to another house.


3. Have you ever lost your pet? Has it ever been so sick? Tell me about an unforgettable with your pet from the
beginning to the end.

Fortunately I have never lost my pet but my pet has ever been sick. When it turned 12 years old, I noticed
some differences in my pet. It was consistently drained and suddenly lost its fur a lot. Some told me it could
happen with an old dog but I knew it was not a usual change happening between seasons. I visited the vet
immediately hoping my concern would have been wrong. He examined my pet and ran through some detailed
tests. After a couple of days, the vet notified me that my pet had a cancer in its womb. I was shocked but the
vet told me it was the early stage of cancer. We quickly schedule the surgery. My pet had to be hospitalized
more than a week. Thankfully the surgery was very successful and my pet was recovered soon. What if I had
neglected some differences on my pet, what if I had visited the vet little late; I was really gratified with my
decision not to ignore the differences and to go to the vet instantly.
