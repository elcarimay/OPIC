## 1. You indicated in your survey you have a pet. I would like to know why you have a pet. Are there any benefits? Please tell me about it in detail.
```
Before I had my own pet, I didn’t really understand what it meant to have one.
I thought it would be easy—just like owning something in my room.
But it turned out to be completely different from what I expected.

Having a pet requires a lot of responsibility, almost like taking care of a child.
At the same time, it’s also more rewarding than anything else I own.
Even when I’m alone in my room, I don’t feel lonely anymore.
My pet gives me a sense of responsibility, and I feel really happy when I see it eat well.

I have a reptile called a Crested Gecko.
It’s so unique and cute that almost everyone who visits my house finds it interesting.

From a practical point of view, it’s very easy to take care of.
It doesn’t shed hair, doesn’t bark, eats only once every two days, and doesn’t need baths.
All I need to do is change the kitchen towel lining when it gets dirty and clean the breeding tank once every two weeks.

That’s why I chose this pet — it’s low-maintenance, but still feels like part of the family.
So far, I’ve never regretted having a pet, and I’m really happy to have it in my life.

## 2. Do you remember the first time you got your pet? How did you feel when you first saw it? How did you get it?
```
One day, my wife sent me a really cute picture on KakaoTalk, but I had no idea what kind of animal it was.
I was amazed and curious, because I had never seen anything like it before.

After doing some research, I found out it was called a Crested Gecko — a small reptile native to an island called New Caledonia.
Interestingly, it’s considered an endangered species in that region, so it’s rarely found in the wild and is mostly preserved by people who raise them as pets.

I thought it was so adorable that I decided to get one.
I visited a nearby reptile shop and met many other reptile lovers.
I also received a lot of help from a Naver Cafe community, where personal transactions of reptiles were very active.

The first gecko I brought home was a morph called Red Lily, which had a beautiful mix of red and white colors.
It was small, cute, and incredibly fast — so my son named it Speed.

But at the end of last year, we decided to send it to another home, and now someone else is taking care of it.

## 3. Have you ever lost your pet? Has it ever been so sick? Tell me about an unforgettable with your pet from the beginning to the end.
```
There have been times when I sold or gave away a gecko, but I’ve never lost one.
Actually, just yesterday, I heard that the gecko I sent to an acquaintance last winter had passed away.
It was heartbreaking to hear that she died without even living for a year, but there’s nothing I can do now — I have to accept the situation.

Recently, I noticed that one of my geckos had a strange-looking eye.
Since it didn’t improve after a few days, I decided to take it to a nearby animal hospital.
Fortunately, the vet there specializes in exotic animals like reptiles.

After examining the gecko, the vet explained that a blood vessel in its eye had become a little enlarged, which made it look strange — but it wasn’t serious.
I felt so relieved to hear that.
The vet also told me that Crested Geckos are generally very healthy and rarely need to visit the hospital.

In any case, I’m really glad that none of the geckos I currently have are sick, and I’ll continue doing my best to take good care of them.
