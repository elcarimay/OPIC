## 1. You indicated in your survey you have a pet. I would like to know why you have a pet. Are there any benefits? Please tell me about it in detail.
```
Before I have my own pet I did not know what it means to have a pet. I thought it would be easy to have a
pet just like things I have in my room. However, it is totally different from what I expected. Having a pet takes
enormous responsibility just like having a child but at the same time gives me more rewarding than any other
things I have. Even if I'm alone in my room, I don't think I'm alone. And they gives me a sense of responsibility,
but they makes me feel good when they eat well. I have a reptile called Crested Gekko. They are so unique and cute
that they are very popular to almost peoples who visit my house. From a managerial point of view, you don't lose hair,
bark, eat once every two days, and don't need a shower or bath. Just change the kitchen towel, which is a flooring
material, when you feel dirty, and clean the breeding bin once every two weeks. This is why I have a pet. It feels
like a family. I have never regretted having a pet so far.

## 2. Do you remember the first time you got your pet? How did you feel when you first saw it? How did you get it?
```
One day, my wife sent me a very cute picture on Kakaotalk, but I didn't know what kind of animal it was. It was
 amazing and curious because it was the first animal I've ever seen. When I searched, Crested Gekko was a small animal
 that lived on an island called New Caledonia, but it was an endangered species in the region, so it was rarely in
 nature and was preserved as people took it and raised it. It was so cute that I decided to bring it, went to a nearby
 reptile shop, and met many people. In particular, I received a lot of help from Naver Cafe, and transactions between
 individuals were active. So at first, it was sold through personal transactions. It was a morph called Red Lily, and
 red and white were harmonized and small and cute. It was so fast that my son named it Speed, but at the end of last
 year, he sent it to another house.

## 3. Have you ever lost your pet? Has it ever been so sick? Tell me about an unforgettable with your pet from the beginning to the end.
```
There have been times when Geko was sold and disappeared, but I have never lost it. In fact, I heard yesterday that the
gecko who sent to an acquaintance for free went to heaven. I sent it last winter, I was heartbroken because she died without living for a year, but the situation can't be changed and must be accepted. Recently, there was an gecko that looked a little strange eye to me. I went to a nearby hospital because it remained the same even after a few days. The veterinarian, who can treat special animals, examined it. And he
said that the bloodline in his eyes got a little bigger, so its eyes looked a little strange. I was relieved about that news.
And the doctor said that Cre is a healthy animal and rarely comes to the hospital. Anyway, I'm glad there were no sick
individuals in my house.
