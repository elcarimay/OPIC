One is Thankgiving, called 추석 in korean, and the other one is Lunar New Year, called 설날 in Korean.

On these days, every family member gets together to celebrate the holiday.
They also talk about how they are doing.

They eat rice-cake soup called Tteok-guk. It is made of slices of rice cake, beef, eggs, etc.
When Koreans eat Tteok-guk, we belive that we get 1 year older.
It is an old tradition.

They play some Korean traditional game,Yut-nori. It's a kind of a board game.

One special thing is that they hold a memorial service for their ancestors.

These days, I see many people travel abroad or nearby to spend their national holidays.
