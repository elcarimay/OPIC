## Q1) Let's talk about your shopping habits. How often do you go shopping? What do you most often buy? Where do you go for shopping?
```
Well, my shopping habits? I do shopping at differenct places such as department store, outlet mall, local stores and online malls.  
And sometimes from overseas when I go on a trip. Actually, there is one I usually go to a big outlet mall is not too far from my  
place. So I think usually go there on weekends even though I don't need anything, yeah~ I love window shopping. So when I go to the  
store, I browse new products and try them on.
Yeah actually I prefer go to the store when I go for a shopping and find thing I like. After that, I look for the same or similar  
styles online. Because online mall usually offers better deal compared to the offline store.  
And I usually go there by myself because I can take more time and avoid impulse buying. Yeah, whenever I am with freinds, I tend to  
buy more things. That's why I like to go shopping alone especially when I go to the mall near my house.  
I think that's all about my shopping habits.
```
## Q2) When was the last time you went to shopping for something? Where did you go, and what did you buy? Whom did you go with? what was special about that shopping experience? Give me all the details.
```
The last time I went to shopping was last week. Yeah I went to department store to buy my friend's birthday gift. I went to the mall  
called "AK Plaza" which is located about 20 minutes from my place by car I mean.  
As I mentioned, I usually shop online but I had to go to the store because I forgot to buy his birthday gift and I knew he would be  
disapppinted. Anyway, I went there by myself after work and I was in a hurry because I didn't have enough time before see him.  
Honestly, there was nothing special about that shopping experience but sales associates at the store was very friendly and helpful.  
Since I'm not very good at measuring sizes, they asked me his height, skin color and his style. After that, they recommended cream  
color sweater and it was just perfect one for my friend. He hit well and really liked it. Yeah, that's my last time went shopping  
and it was pretty good.
```
## Q3) People sometimes go through difficulties while they are shopping. What are some problems you had to deal with while you were shopping?
```
I remember a time when I was shopping for some shoes. I think it happened in September at the mall. I went to the mall with my friend  
because she wanted to get some stuff before her trip. But honestly for me, I had nothing to buy but I found one sneakers I really  
like and I ended up buying it because it looked good on me so I didn't hesitate to buy it.
After I came here, I checked its price online and guess what happened? it's price was way cheaper like 40%. So I decided to return them.  
Anyway, after a work, I went back to the store and the problem was I didn't have the same credit card when I bought that shoes.  
Because I lost my credit card. Furthermore, I didn't have a receipt. So the store refused to refund. Yeah, I admit it was my fault.  
But I knew there is certain kind of way to give me a refund.  
Later, I could get a refund as I provided my lost credit card number. It was pretty challenging experience to me because the shos  
I bought was quite pricy and I hate overpaying. That was the problem regarding my shopping experience.
```
## Q4) Have you ever had a problem with something that you bought? What was the problem, and how did you deal with it?
```
Well, actually there are many problems with shopping and let me tell you some of them.  
One time, I went to the buy some shoes, white running shoes, yeah it was trendy item at that time so I wanted to get one like everybody  
does and when I went to the store, I found what I like but my size was sold out and the sad thing was it was out-of-stock.  
I was disappointed but decided to buy similar one online. I know.. buying shoes and clothes online is not a great idea but I was  
in a hurry and had to get it. The shoes came from overseas and it took about 10 days to get it.  
And what happened was and it's color was totally different from what I expected. I was very disappointed and contacted the seller.  
She said, I am responsible for shipping fee and since it's shipping price was free, I need to owe her $50.  
I didn't want to keep that shoes so I returned that shoes and paid for shipping. After that, I try to be more careful when I buy things  
online. Since then, I read return policy more throughly. Yeah, that's what happened.
```
## Q5) What are some major changes in people's shopping habits? Where do they shop most often? What do people most often buy?
```
Well, major change in shopping? I think there are many things to talk about but let me tell you some of them. The first change is  
online shopping. In the past, people had to go to the store to buy some stuff. I mean everything .. shoes, clothing, furniture,  
electronic products and groceries and others but nowadays many things have been changed.  
Now, people don't need to go to the store instead they can look at things with their computer or smartphone and order online  
it's usually convenient and cheaper. Even grocery shopping is available online. After few clicks, it will be delivered to their  
door in a couple of hours. Also, many people buy things from overseas. I mean they can order things directly from the internet.  
People can literally buy everything .. before, people had to pay more to get things what they wanted for example, I am a big fan  
of apple. So I usually compare its price. And it's usually cheaper in the U.S than Korea. So many people order it from overseas.  
I think these are some changes in people's shopping habits.
```
## Q6) What are sine hot products or services that people talk about these days?
```
Hot products? well, there are so many but let me you about my earpods, which is Bluetooth earphone thing made by apple.  
As most people listen to music on their smartphone, people used to have wired headsets so they could enjoy listening to the  
music on the move. However, we don't need that kind any more. Now, bluetooth headset is available in the market so it doesn't  
come with wires any more but it get connected to the smart phone signal. And it's quality is even much better, nowadays.  
So lots of people enjoy it. When this products was released, people were worried because people can easily lose them still  
regardless of this problem, many people users love this products and it's been popular. Yeah, I also have this one and  
I am in love with this product. I think that's all.
