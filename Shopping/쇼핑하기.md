## Q1) Let's talk about your shopping habits. How often do you go shopping? What do you most often buy? Where do you go for shopping?
```
Well, my shopping habits? I usually shop at different places like department stores, outlet malls, local shops, and online malls.
Sometimes, I even buy things from overseas when I travel.

There’s a large outlet mall not too far from where I live, so I often go there on weekends, even if I don’t need anything.
I really enjoy window shopping, so when I visit, I like to browse new products and try things on.

Actually, I prefer to go to a physical store first to see and try the item in person.
Then, I often search for the same or similar styles online, because online malls usually offer better deals than offline stores.

Yeah, that’s pretty much it — that’s how I usually do my shopping.
```
## Q2) When was the last time you went to shopping for something? Where did you go, and what did you buy? Whom did you go with? what was special about that shopping experience? Give me all the details.
```
Sometimes I go shopping when I feel like I don’t have anything to wear.
There’s a mid- to low-priced clothing brand near my house that I really like, so I often shop there.

About a month ago, I went to the store to buy some light summer pants.
My son and wife came with me, and they picked out one pair for me, while I chose three others.
I tried them all on and finally made my decision.

My son and wife wanted me to buy something in a bright color, but I personally prefer dark colors,
so in the end, I bought a black pair of pants.

The store owner recognized me as a regular customer and was very kind —
he gave my son some jelly as a gift and gave me a pair of socks for free.
Also, I was able to earn mileage points for buying two pairs of pants.

After that, I thought to myself, "Next time, I should come back and buy some shorts!"

## Q3) People sometimes go through difficulties while they are shopping. What are some problems you had to deal with while you were shopping?
```
I remember a time when I went shopping for my wife’s birthday gift.
I went to a department store to buy her a dress.

She went into the fitting room to try it on, and a few minutes later, she came out without the dress on, and her face looked a bit flushed.
I asked her what was wrong, and she said she had something to talk to me about.

She told me that while she was trying on the dress, she realized the lace part was torn, and she felt really embarrassed.
So we went to talk to the store manager about it.

The manager apologized and asked if we would be willing to buy the dress at half price.
After thinking about it, we agreed. When we got home, we took it to a nearby tailor, and they were able to fix it perfectly.
Now the dress looks great, and my wife still wears it.

That’s my most recent shopping experience, and although it was unexpected, it turned out well in the end.
```
## Q4) Have you ever had a problem with something that you bought? What was the problem, and how did you deal with it?
```
Well, actually, there are many problems that can happen while shopping, and let me tell you about one of them.

One time, I went out to buy a pair of white running shoes.
They were really trendy at the time, and I wanted to get a pair like everyone else.
When I went to the store, I found a pair I really liked, but unfortunately, my size was sold out, and the shoes were completely out of stock.

I was disappointed, but I decided to buy a similar pair online.
I know buying shoes or clothes online isn’t always the best idea, but I was in a hurry and really wanted them.

The shoes were shipped from overseas, and it took about 10 days to arrive.
But when I opened the box, the color was totally different from what I expected. I was really disappointed, so I contacted the seller.

Since I didn’t want to keep the shoes, I decided to return them.
After that experience, I’ve learned to be more careful when shopping online, especially for clothing or shoes.

Yeah, that’s what happened.
```
## Q5) What are some major changes in people's shopping habits? Where do they shop most often? What do people most often buy?
```
Well, major changes in shopping? I think there are many things to talk about, but let me share a few of them.

The biggest change is definitely online shopping.
In the past, people had to go to physical stores to buy everything — shoes, clothes, furniture, electronics, and even groceries.
But nowadays, things have changed a lot.

Now, people can shop using their computers or smartphones and place orders online.
It’s usually more convenient and even cheaper than going to a store.
Even grocery shopping can be done online now — just a few clicks, and the items are delivered to your door within a few hours.

Also, many people buy things from overseas using global online platforms.
For example, I’m a big fan of Apple products, and I often compare prices online.
Most of the time, it's cheaper to buy from the U.S. than in Korea, so many people order directly from foreign websites.

I think these are some of the major changes in shopping habits we see today.
```
## Q6) What are sine hot products or services that people talk about these days?
```
Hot products? Well, there are so many these days, but let me tell you about my earpods, which are Bluetooth earphones made by a Korean company called iRiver.

These days, most people listen to music on their smartphones, and in the past, we used wired headsets to enjoy music while on the move.
However, that’s no longer necessary. Now we have Bluetooth headsets that connect wirelessly to our phones.
They're more convenient, and the sound quality has improved a lot compared to the past.

When this product was first released, many people were worried about losing them easily, since there are no wires.
But despite that, Bluetooth earphones have become extremely popular, and many people love using them — including me!
I also have a pair, and I’m really happy with them. I use them almost every day, and they’ve become one of my favorite tech items.

Yeah, that’s all about one of the hottest products I use.
