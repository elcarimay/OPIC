## Q1) Let's talk about your shopping habits. How often do you go shopping? What do you most often buy? Where do you go for shopping?
```
Well, my shopping habits? I do shopping at differenct places such as department store, outlet mall, local stores and online malls.  
And sometimes from overseas when I go on a trip. Actually, there is one I usually go to a big outlet mall is not too far from my  
place. So I think usually go there on weekends even though I don't need anything, I love window shopping. So when I go to the  
store, I browse new products and try them on.
Actually, I prefer go to the store when I go for a shopping and find thing I like. After that, I look for the same or similar  
styles online. Because online mall usually offers better deal compared to the offline store.  
I think that's all about my shopping habits.
```
## Q2) When was the last time you went to shopping for something? Where did you go, and what did you buy? Whom did you go with? what was special about that shopping experience? Give me all the details.
```
Sometimes I go shopping when I don't have clothes to wear. There is a mid- to low-priced brand that I like near my house, so I sometimes
go shopping there. One month ago, I went to the store to buy thin summmer pants. My son and wife picked one for me, and I picked three
different ones I tried it on and decided. My son and wife wanted to buy some bright colors, but I liked dark colors, so I ended up buying
black pants. The boss recognized that I was a regular customer and gave my son jelly as a gift and gave me socks as a service. I was able
to earn mileage for 2 pairs of pants. I thought I should go buy shorts next time.

## Q3) People sometimes go through difficulties while they are shopping. What are some problems you had to deal with while you were shopping?
```
I remember a time when I was shopping for my wife's dress. I went to the department store to buy clothes for my wife's birthday present.
My wife went to the dressing room to try on her clothes. A few minutes later my wife came out and she didn't wear new clothes and her face
was a little flushed. I asked why, and my wife said she had something to discuss with me. When I heard the reason why, when she tried on the
clothes in the dressing room, she was embarrassed because the lace part was torn. We talked to the manager, the manager asked if my wife was
willing to buy the clothes at half price. We decided to buy it and when we got home, we went to a nearby repair shop. It was mended and worn
well. That's the most recent shopping experience I've had.
```
## Q4) Have you ever had a problem with something that you bought? What was the problem, and how did you deal with it?
```
Well, actually there are many problems with shopping and let me tell you some of them.  
One time, I went to the buy some shoes, white running shoes, it was trendy item at that time so I wanted to get one like everybody  
does and when I went to the store, I found what I like but my size was sold out and the sad thing was it was out-of-stock.  
I was disappointed but decided to buy similar one online. I know.. buying shoes and clothes online is not a great idea but I was  
in a hurry and had to get it. The shoes came from overseas and it took about 10 days to get it.  
And what happened was and it's color was totally different from what I expected. I was very disappointed and contacted the seller.  
I didn't want to keep that shoes so I returned that shoes. After that, I try to be more careful when I buy things online. That's what happened.

## Q5) What are some major changes in people's shopping habits? Where do they shop most often? What do people most often buy?
```
Well, major change in shopping? I think there are many things to talk about but let me tell you some of them. The first change is  
online shopping. In the past, people had to go to the store to buy some stuff. I mean everything .. shoes, clothing, furniture,  
electronic products and groceries and others but nowadays many things have been changed.  
Now, people don't need to go to the store instead they can look at things with their computer or smartphone and order online.  
It's usually convenient and cheaper. Even grocery shopping is available online. After few clicks, it will be delivered to their  
door in a couple of hours. Also, many people buy things from overseas. I mean they can order things directly from the internet.  
For example, I am a big fan of apple. So I usually compare its price. And it's usually cheaper in the U.S than Korea. So many
people order it from overseas. I think these are some changes in people's shopping habits.
```
## Q6) What are sine hot products or services that people talk about these days?
```
Hot products? well, there are so many but let me you about my earpods, which is Bluetooth earphone thing made by apple.  
As most people listen to music on their smartphone, people used to have wired headsets so they could enjoy listening to the  
music on the move. However, we don't need that kind any more. Now, bluetooth headset is available in the market so it doesn't  
come with wires any more but it get connected to the smart phone signal. And it's quality is even much better, nowadays.  
So lots of people enjoy it. When this products was released, people were worried because people can easily lose them still  
regardless of this problem, many people users love this products and it's been popular. Yeah, I also have this one and  
I am in love with this product. I think that's all.
