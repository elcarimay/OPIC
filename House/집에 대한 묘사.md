##Q1) Please tell me about your house. Where is it located? What does it look like?
Which one is your favorite furniture? Please tell me everything about your house.

I live in an apartment in Dontan. The building was brand new when we moved in. 
Itâ€™s really a great residential area. My office isn't far from here. It takes me an 15 minute everyday. 
Each building has about 24 stories. My place is on the 22th floor.
There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The main room have my bed, a AC, a balcony, a dress room.
My favorite room is the living room. It has the couch which has a reclining function, so I can lie down and watch TV.
So I always stay on it after work. I think it's best to buy it this year. It really relieves stress.
And I always feel really cozy and comfy here in my place.
So, overall I really love my place.

##Q2) Please compare the home you used to live in when you were a child with the one you live in now.
Are there any similarities or differences? Please tell me in detail.

This is a pretty difficult question because I haven't thought about it. Could you give em a minute to think?
Let me compare the place I used to live in with my parents and the one I live in now.
I used to live with my parents in a really spacious nice house.
The place was always like clean and tidy Because my mother cleaned every day.
And as for the neighborhood the town I used to live in was like popular among families with the children.
There were a lot of schools and there was a really nice park.

##Q) Have you had any problems at home? For instance a piece of furniture or home appliance could because
broken or damaged. How did you handle the situation?

I've definitely had some problems at home. Last summer the AC in the living room just stopped working.
It was kind of a big problem because it happened in the sweltering summer.
It was so boiling so I had to get it fixed as soon as possible but I couldn't because there were a lot of 
people like me waiting for their AC to be repaired.
So, I had no choice but to wait but I couldn't stay at home during the day.
I couldn't stand the heat it was like so boiling.
Finally I got it fixed but it cost me quit a bit of money but I had to get it fixed.

What's more once had a problem with the refrigerator in my kitchen.
It broke down and actually when I opened the door of the friege.
I found a lot of spoiled food. So I called the customer service but they said it couldn't be fixed
because it was too old. It was really outdated. I kind of had used the fridge more than 10 years.
So, I had no choice to buy. I had no choice but to buy a new one.
There are the problems that I've had at home.

##Q) The furniture in people's homes has changed over the years. Please tell me about the furniture you had
when you were young. How is it differenct from furniture you have today? Give me specific examples.

There have been changes when it comes to furniture in my house.
As far as I remember, my family used to have the furniture was really sophisticated design and it
had bold colors.
However, the furniture I have in my house almost prefabricated and I made some, so it feels a little crude.
And as for the common household furniture I think the design has become simpler and has become modernized right?
And I remember the furniture used to be quite price but these days we can get like decent furniture at
reasonable prices online. There are lots of online furniture stores right?
And also the range of options has become much wider than before.
So I think yeah there are all the changes when it comes to furniture.

##Q) Have you ever had any problem with your furniture? Perhaps it could have gotten damaged for some reason.
Tell me what exactly happened and how you dealt with the problem in as much detail as possible.

I don't think I've had a lot of problems with the furniture in my place.
But actually I used to have really old furniture.
It was really old fashioned and outdated.
So, I always wanted to buy some decent ones.
When I moved into the studio apartment I bought some nice furniture but I had to spend a lot of money.
It was quite pricey but I've been really satisfied with the new furniture in my studio apartment now.
I think this is all I can tell you for this question.

##Q) Tell me about your responsibilities and duties at home when you were young.

Well, as a child, I had many reponsibilities, but I wasn't really useful, because I was still a child.
I couldn't do much. But let me just tell you a couple of things that I did.
I guess the first thing that I did was cleaning the house.
For example, I vacummed the floor or I simply just mop the floor because I wanted to keep my house clean
and I still wanted to help my mom.
And secondly, I guess I did the dishes. I wan't a good cook, so my mom was cooking for us.
However, I still tried to do the dishes for my mom.
How simple is it? So I felt like I had to do something and I was so rewarded.
In conclusion, as a child, I was useless. However, I did some responsibilities.
