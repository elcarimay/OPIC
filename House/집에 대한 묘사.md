## Q1) Please tell me about your house. Where is it located? What does it look like? Which one is your favorite furniture? Please tell me everything about your house.

I live in an apartment in Dongtan. The building was brand new when we moved in, and it’s really a great residential area.
My office isn’t far from here — it takes me about 15 minutes to get there every day.

Each building has around 24 stories, and my place is on the 22nd floor.
There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms.
The master bedroom has my bed, an air conditioner, a balcony, and a walk-in closet.

My favorite room is the living room.
It has a couch with a reclining function, so I can lie down and watch TV comfortably.
I always relax on it after work, and honestly, I think it’s the best thing I bought this year.
It really helps me relieve stress.

Overall, I feel really cozy and comfortable in my home — and I truly love living here.

## Q2) Please compare the home you used to live in when you were a child with the one you live in now. Are there any similarities or differences? Please tell me in detail.  

Hmm, that’s a pretty difficult question because I haven’t really thought about it before.
Could you give me a minute to think?

Okay, let me compare the place I used to live with my parents and the place I live in now.

I used to live with my parents in a very spacious and nice house.
The place was always clean and tidy because my mother cleaned it every day — she really took great care of our home.

As for the neighborhood, it was a very family-friendly area, especially popular among families with children.
There were plenty of schools nearby, and there was a beautiful park where people could walk or exercise.

## Q3) Have you had any problems at home? For instance a piece of furniture or home appliance could because broken or damaged. How did you handle the situation?  

I've definitely had some problems at home.
Last summer, the air conditioner in the living room suddenly stopped working, and it was a big problem because it happened during the sweltering heat.

It was boiling hot, and I knew I had to get it fixed as soon as possible.
But unfortunately, there were a lot of people like me waiting for AC repairs, so I had no choice but to wait.
During the day, I just couldn’t stay at home — it was way too hot and uncomfortable.

Finally, after a few days, I got it fixed.
It cost quite a bit of money, but I had no other option.
At that point, I didn’t care about the cost — I just wanted to survive the summer heat.

## Q4) The furniture in people's homes has changed over the years. Please tell me about the furniture you had when you were young. How is it differenct from furniture you have today? Give me specific examples.  

There have definitely been some changes when it comes to furniture in my home.

As far as I remember, my family used to have furniture with very sophisticated designs and bold colors.
It looked quite luxurious and elegant.

But the furniture I have now is mostly prefabricated, and I even assembled some of it myself.
So compared to the past, it feels a bit more simple and practical, maybe even a little crude.

In general, I think household furniture design has become simpler and more modern over time.
Also, I remember that furniture used to be quite expensive, but these days, you can find decent-quality furniture at reasonable prices online.
There are so many online furniture stores now, and the range of options has become much wider than before.

So yeah, I’d say there have been a lot of changes when it comes to furniture — from the design and price to how and where we buy it.

## Q5) Have you ever had any problem with your furniture? Perhaps it could have gotten damaged for some reason. Tell me what exactly happened and how you dealt with the problem in as much detail as possible.  

I don’t think I’ve had many problems with the furniture in my home.
But there was one serious issue — it had to do with radon, a radioactive material that was found in some mattresses.

The problem came from mattresses made by a specific company, and unfortunately, my mattress was one of their products.
On the day I saw the news, I rushed home after work and took the bed apart immediately.
It was heartbreaking because I had only bought it recently, but for the sake of my family’s health, I threw it away in the recycling area.

Even though it was a difficult decision, I knew it was the right thing to do.
I think that’s the only major furniture-related issue I’ve experienced so far.

## Q6) Tell me about your responsibilities and duties at home when you were young.  

Well, as a child, I had some responsibilities, but to be honest, I wasn’t very useful — I was still just a kid, so there wasn’t much I could do.
But let me share a couple of things I did help with.

First, I helped with cleaning the house.
For example, I would vacuum or mop the floor. I just wanted to keep the house clean and do something to help my mom.

Second, I helped with doing the dishes.
I wasn’t a good cook, so my mom did all the cooking for us.
But I still tried to take care of the dishes afterward to lighten her load.

It was a simple task, but I felt good about doing it.
Even though I couldn’t do much, I felt proud and rewarded for helping in small ways.

So in conclusion, I may not have been very useful as a child, but I did have some small responsibilities — and I did my best.
