## 1. What are your responsibilities in the home? How do you handle those tasks?
```
Yes, I do have some responsibilities at home, and I usually take care of small household chores.

First of all, I’m mostly in charge of washing the dishes and sorting the recycling.
When I get home from work, I usually eat the food I took out earlier, and then I start with the dishes.
After that, I check my son’s homework and help him if he needs it.

On weekends, I separate and take out the recycling.
In our neighborhood, paper can only be thrown away on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so on other days, I separate plastic, cans, styrofoam, and vinyl.
Then, I use the elevator to take everything down to the recycling area on the first floor.

I used to throw away food waste myself, but after we bought a food processor, things got much easier.
Now, I just need to throw away the dried debris in the trash can.
Honestly, buying that food processor was one of the best decisions I made this year!

Sometimes I also help with small household tasks like reaching things on high shelves, tightening screws, or moving heavy items.

And even though it’s more of a hobby, I take full care of our small pet — a Crested Gecko.
My son helps me out sometimes, and it’s something we enjoy doing together.

## 2. What are your family members' responsibilities? Tell me about the types of things they are asked to do.
```
My wife does most of the household chores.
She prepares all the meals for our family, and doing the laundry is also her responsibility.
She knows how to handle different fabrics and colors carefully.
Of course, we fold the laundry and organize it together afterward.

Cleaning the house is also mostly her job, especially because I usually go out with my son to exercise.
When it comes to the bathroom, she takes care of it completely.
She usually cleans the bathroom while she’s taking a shower, so it becomes part of her routine.

My son is responsible for putting food into the refrigerator after meals.
At first, he struggled with organizing things properly, especially when I told him to separate the items,
but now he’s getting better at it.

Now that I think about the responsibilities each family member has, I realize that my wife handles a lot at home.
I should definitely try to help her more.

## 3. Have you ever changed the interior of the house? If so, when is it? Please tell me in detail.
```
Actually, I usually choose a place for things in the house carefully and keep everything in its designated spot,
so the house stays fairly organized and requires less cleaning.

But the problem is, my wife loves changing the interior design.
She wants to rearrange things every three months or so.
Sometimes she even moves things on her own without asking for help, so I get surprised when I come home and see everything in a different place!

About a year ago, my wife asked me to put a bookcase in the living room and move the TV to the master bedroom for our son’s education.
Of course, I said no at first, but since my wife is the real leader of the house, her decision was final.
So the TV was moved into the main room, and the bookshelf went into the living room.

The funny part is, a few months later, we all ended up spending time in the small bedroom to watch TV together.
I started to think it was actually less efficient to have the whole family squeezed into one narrow space.

Eventually, about three months ago, we bought a larger TV and moved it back to the living room, along with the sofa.
Since then, we’ve been much more satisfied with the layout.
In the end, I realized there’s a good reason why TVs and sofas are usually placed in the living room!
