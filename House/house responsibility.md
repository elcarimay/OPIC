## 1. What are your responsibilities in the home? How do you handle those tasks?
```
I do have some responsibilities in the home. I usually do small house chores. 
First of all, the dishes are almost in charge of separate collection. When I go home after work, I eat the 
food that I took out first and start with the dishes. After that, I check my son's homework and help him.
I do separate the waste on weekends. Paper has to be thrown away only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so the rest
of the plastic, cans, styrofoam, and vinyl are separated, and then used as an elevator to go to the recycling
area on the first floor and throw them away. Fortunately, I used to throw away food, but after buying a food
processor, I became very comfortable. Sometimes you just have to throw the debris in the trash can.
I think the best thing I've done this year is to buy a food processor. Sometimes I have to take things out of
heights, put screws on them, or move heavy things. And even though it's my hobby, I take full care of a small
pet called Crested Gekko. and my son helps me sometimes.

## 2. What are your family members' responsibilities? Tell me about the types of things they are asked to do.
```
My wife does most of house chores. She prepares all meals for us. Doing laundry is also her job.
She knows how to deal with different fabrics and colors. Of course, we fold the laundry and organize it together.
Cleaning the house is mostly her job because I used to go out with my son for doing exersize. 
When it comes to bathrooms, she cleans it entirely. This is because she cleans the bathroom together when she
takes a shower. My son is responsible for putting food in the refrigerator after meals. Even though I was told
to put them in separately, he had a hard time putting them all in at once. Now I think of responsibilities my 
family members share, I have realized that my wifer does a lot of things at home. I should help her more.

## 3. Have you ever changed the interior of the house? If so, when is it? Please tell me in detail.
```
In fact, I usually choose a place to put things in the house carefully and put them in a designated place, so 
they are always organized and less cleaned. The problem is that my wife loves to change the interior. She wants
to change the interior once every three months. I sometimes move to my own will regardless of help. So there are
times when I'm surprised. Anyway, a year ago, my wife asked me to put a bookcase in the living room and move the
TV to the main room for my son's education. Of course, I said no, but my wife's opinion, the leader of my house,
was absolute, so the TV went to the main room and the bookshelf was in the living room. The problem was that a few
months later, not all of my family lived in the living room, but in the main room to watch TV. Rather, I thought 
it was inefficient to live in a narrow room. So eventuallym, after buying a bigger TV three months ago and moved
it back to the living room with the sofa, and we still satisfied with the interior. In general, I thought there
was a reason for putting TV and sofas in the living room.
