## 집에서 하는 일(주중/주말)
```
On weekdays, I clean the house as often as I can.
First, I open all the windows.
I vacuum and mop the floors. I also dust the furniture.
Plus, I clean the bathroom after I take showers.
Next, I do the dishes after I have meals.

On weekends, I do the laundry.
I first separate the whites and the colors.
I throw my laundry in the washer.
And then, I hand-dry the laundry on the laundry rack.
When they dry, I fold the clothes and put them in the dresser.

Plus, on weekends, I take out the garbage.
I take out the recycling and the food waste separately.

So, these are the housework I do at home.
