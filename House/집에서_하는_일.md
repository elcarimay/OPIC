## 집에서 하는 일(주중/주말)
```
On weekdays, I try to clean the house as often as I can.
First, I open all the windows to let in some fresh air.
Then I vacuum and mop the floors, and I also dust the furniture.
After taking a shower, I clean the bathroom as well.
And of course, I do the dishes after every meal.

On weekends, I usually take care of the laundry.
I start by separating the whites and the colored clothes.
Then I put them in the washing machine, and once they’re done, I hang them on the laundry rack to dry.
After they dry, I fold the clothes and put them neatly in the dresser.

Also on weekends, I take out the garbage.
I separate the recycling and food waste and take them out to the designated bins.

So yeah, these are the household chores I usually do at home.
