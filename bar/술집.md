## Q1) You indicated that you go to bars. Describe the bar you go to most often. Tell me everything about the place in detail.
```
There are tons of bars and pubs in Korea. Actually, they are everywhere. They are all over the places.  
And most of them are located around subway station or college town.  
Anyway, let me tell you one of the bar/pub where I usually go to. Personally, I like to go to a pub near my office.  
It's a local bar that serves draft beer. I like going there because I like the food and atmosphere. And I really  
like to going to a Korean style bar where I can have some Korean rice wine called makgeolli. It's not too far from where  
I live, so I usually go there when I want to be lazy and do nothing or stressed out. And actually, I'm a regular there.  
I like to go there from time to time because I like the food they serve. They serve one the best kimchi stew  
which is my favorite side dish to drink with.
```
## Q2) Tell me about what people normally do at bars. What do you personally do there? Who do you normally go with? Tell me everything about your experience of going to bars.
```
I think most people go to bars to meet their friends. And I'm one of them. I typically go to bars for social gatherings.  
And I usually go there to grab some drinks with some side dishes. Drinks help me to break the ice and spice up the mood.  
And since my friends and I also like to drink so we sometimes do several rounds. Also, I go there with my co-workers for  
staff dinner or end of the year party things. It's a great place to get together so they can catch up with their friends and  
co-workers when needed. Overall, that's I do at the bar. / That's all about What I do at the bars.
```
## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident/experience that happened at a bar. What exactly happened, and why was it special? Tell me everything about that drinking experience at a bar.
```
When I was a freshman in college, I went to a 3:3 meeting, and we went to a beer place. 3 men and 3 women were talking about  
college's life and we began to drink a lot of beer. I tried to look good to women of my age because I was young. I thought  
drinking a lot of beer would be like a man, so I competed with my friend. I drank 10,000cc of bamboo beer with my friend, so  
I went back and forth to the bathroom more than 5 times. Even after the girls went home, we got drunk, so we kept drinking beer
and went home after drinking until 1 a.m. Now that I think about it, it was very stupid.  
Since then, I try not to drink a lot. Yeah, It was a memorable experience that happened at a bar.
```
## Q4) How have pubs changed over the years? How were they in the past, and how are they now? What are the differences and the similarities? Give me all the details.
```
Pubs in Korea have changed a lot over the years. In the past, they mostly served domestic beer. So people didn't have many  
choices. As I remember, my dad used to drink OB beer which was really popular in tha past. But, now they serve various types  
of imported beer so people can try from all over the world. In my case, I think Korean beers taste too light so I prefer  
imported ones I usually drink German beer. If you haven't tried yet, I strongly recommend them.  
Another big change is indoor smoking, it is banned nowadays. In the past, people used to smoke indoor so they could drink and  
smoke at the same time. And non-smokers were exposed to it. But nowadays, it's illegal. People are not allowed to do that  
anymore since second-hand smoking has been a big issue. And it cause lots of health problems. And nowadays smokers can only  
smoke at designated smoking areas. Yeah, I think these are two changes in terms of pubs.
