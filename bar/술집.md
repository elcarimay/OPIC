## Q1) You indicated that you go to bars. Describe the bar you go to most often. Tell me everything about the place in detail.
```
There are tons of bars and pubs in Korea. Actually, they are everywhere. They are all over the places.  
And most of them are located around subway station or college town.  
Anyway, let me tell you one of the bar/pub where I usually go to. Personally, I like to go to a pub near my office.  
It's a local bar that serves draft beer. I like going there because I like the food and atmosphere. And I really  
like to going to a Korean style bar where I can have some Korean vodka called as soju. It's not too far from where  
I live, so I usually go there when I want to be lazy and do nothing or stressed out. And actually, I'm a regular there.  
I like to go there from time to time because I like the food they serve. They serve one the best spicy beef soup  
which is my favorite side dish to drink with. Sometimes, I go there by myself because I like to grab some drinks at  
the end of the long day. It's a great place to have some drinks, so I totally recommend you to go therer if you have a  
chance.
```
## Q2) Tell me about what people normally do at bars. What do you personally do there? Who do you normally go with? Tell me everything about your experience of going to bars.
```
I think most people go to bars to meet their friends. And I'm one of them. I typically go to bars for social gatherings.  
And I usually go there to grab some drinks with some side dishes. Drinks help me to break the ice and spice up the mood.  
And since my friends and I also like to drink so we sometimes do several rounds and we end up drinking until late at night.  
It's only sometimes yeah.. Also, I go there with my co-workers for staff dinner or special occasion like a birthday  
party or end of the year party things. It's a great place to get together so they can catch up with their friends and  
co-workers when needed. Overall, that's I do at the bar. / That's all about What I do at the bars.
```
## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident/experience that happened at a bar. What exactly happened, and why was it special? Tell me everything about that drinking experience at a bar.
```
I remember going to my birthday party several years ago. It was held at a traditional Korean bar so we ordered Korean beer  
and soju which is Korean vodka. Because we like to mix it together so it tastes much better. Anyway, we ordered lots of  
side dishes to drink with. The food and drinks tasted really good because I was really starving that day and everybody  
was in good mood. So we ended up drinking quite a lot that day. After a couple of drinks, I got very tipsy(술이 약간 취한) but I  
could not stop because it was my birthday. And suddenly I felt like throwing up because I mixed beer and soju.  
I tried to sober up but it wasn't easy. After drinking water, I wanted to go home but I fell down and got a big bruise(멍) on  
my knee. Since then, I try not to drink a lot like I used to but enjoy it in moderation.(절제) Yeah, It was a memorable  
experience that happened at a bar.
```
## Q4) How have pubs changed over the years? How were they in the past, and how are they now? What are the differences and the similarities? Give me all the details.
```
Pubs in Korea have changed a lot over the years. In the past, they mostly served domestic beer. So people didn't have many  
choices. As I remember, my dad used to drink OB beer which was really popular in tha past. But, now they serve various types  
of imported beer so people can try from all over the world. In my case, I think Korean beers taste too light so I prefer  
imported ones I usually drink German beer. If you haven't tried yet, I strongly recommend them.  
Another big change is indoor smoking, it is banned nowadays. In the past, people used to smoke indoor so they could drink and  
smoke at the same time. And non-smokers were exposed to it. But nowadays, it's illegal. People are not allowed to do that  
anymore since second-hand smoking has been a big issue. And it cause lots of health problems. And nowadays smokers can only  
smoke at designated smoking areas. Yeah, I think these are two changes in terms of pubs.
