After this class, I go to my sleeping son. Whenever I saw him,
my wife always told me that please don't wake him up.
Because if I keep an eye on him, I will call my son without thinking.
Then my son wakes up and I get scolded by my wife. That is my daily life
and habit. It doesn't fix well. I'm a fool for my son.
As long as my son studies hard, it will be great.

On the weekend, acquaintances came to play and played in the water.
There was a water playground near my house, and there were many
 children, and I was hot, but I didn't know time was passing by when
 my son was playing. I'm a fool for my son.

I'm going to go camping in Yangyang, Gangwon-do tomorrow. 
There is a water-slideable stream of water. 
I went there last year and it was so good that I made a reservation again.
I'm going to connect Zoom outdoors tomorrow.
Please understand that there may be a lot of noise.

I don't make special food, but I usually eat instant food. But at night, 
we make sure to have a campfire. Humans instinctively came close to fire
and are said to be the driving force behind evolution. Watching the burning
flames clears my mind and makes me feel comfortable. It's a pity that I have
to leave tomorrow, but I'm going to enjoy today. carpe diem. It's latin language.

I had a lot of fun with the water slide, I feel some tired, but my son asked me to
continue that. I think he has infinite physical strength. 

Describe your management style?
When a situation occurs, I first solve it with the information I have or can googling
, and if it doesn't work, I ask for help from people around me. As I said before,
I believe in the power of collective intelligence.

Tell me something about yourself?
I'm interested in getting to know something new about anything. What I'm in the trouble
is that I think someone has already thought about it, so I spend time finding information
and making it mine. In addition, since I know the power of collective intelligence,
I do not hesitate to ask something and share it if I know anything. That's the way I work.  

23. Explain me what do you know about our company?  
I have been working for Samsung Display for 17 years as an engineer. Samsung Display was
established in 2012 and is equipped with smartphones, laptops, monitors, and TVs
We are making premium display products. The company has about 20,000 employees, 34 trillion
won in sales and 6 trillion won in operating profit last year.
It mass-produced flexible OLEDs and foldable displays for the first time in the world and
is currently making large display QD-OLEDs. In fact, the highest sales right now
It's coming from the iPhone, so actually Our company's sales increase only when iPhones are
sold a lot.  

24. Describe what a "lot of work" looks like to you in OPIC? work and life balance  
I prefer to work more efficiently than to do a lot of work. I said that I will do my best  
when I am a new employee. But I'm used to talk that I'll do it right when I become a senior employee.  
In the past, there was an executive who liked a research institute that didn't turn off the light,  
but I hated it so much. I think it is important to balance working time and living time.  
It's called "워라벨" in korean word. That's the way I work.  

25. If you have multiple projects on your plate, how do you handle completing them on time?  
First, try to list up in consideration of priorities and solve them as quickly as possible.  
And I try to solve annoying things when I think of them because they can get more annoying  
in the future.   

26. Who has been an inspiration for you?  
I think everyone around me inspires me. This is because I think there is something to learn in my  
own way, whether it is bad or good. If it's a bad thing, I think I shouldn't do it next time,  
and if it's a good thing, I wonder if there is any improvement.
