## 1. You indicated that you read newspaper in the survey. What is your favorite newspaper? Why do you like reading it?
```
Reading the newspaper has always been one of the best ways to learn about current events and understand what’s happening in the world.
Personally, I really enjoy reading the news.

The first thing I do when I get to work in the morning is check the news posted on the company bulletin board.
Our in-house communication team gathers news from various media outlets and uploads it to the board every day.
I don’t even need to search for it myself — all the key articles are in one place, which makes it really convenient to stay updated.

I think this is one of the perks of working for a large company.
I usually scan the headlines first and then read the articles that interest me.
Since I work at a display company, most of the news is related to semiconductors and electronic components.

Reading the news every day helps me understand what’s going on in the industry, see different perspectives, and even get a sense of how our competitors are doing.
This also helps me gauge the overall business situation of our company — and sometimes I can even guess whether bonuses might be given at the end of the year.

By the way, our business is doing quite well this year, so I’m really looking forward to the end of the year!

## 2. How were you first interested in reading newspaper? When was it? Were there special reasons? What made you start to read it?
```
I became interested in the news for the first time when I was a new employee.
At that time, I was especially interested in e-newspapers, since they were easy to access at work.

Ironically, the company asked me to gather information about our competitors, but at the same time, they told us not to contact any of them directly.
We were strictly told not to meet or call competitors in order to avoid any risk of leaking company information.
Security was taken very seriously.

However, without direct contact, there aren’t many ways to know what competitors are doing.
So I realized that reading newspapers was one of the best ways to learn about them indirectly.
That’s why I believe newspaper articles are very important for office workers. They provide valuable insights about the industry and competitors.

The challenge is that there’s so much information out there, and it takes experience to figure out what’s reliable and what’s actually useful.
I think the old saying, “You see as much as you know,” is really true.

Now, I try to read news articles whenever I have time, and I use them to stay updated on both our industry and our competitors.

## 3. Do you have any unforgettable experience when you read newspaper? When was it? What happened? Tell me about it from the beginning to the end.
```
The most memorable news I’ve seen recently was about OpenAI.
The CEO, Sam Altman, was suddenly fired overnight by the company’s non-profit board of directors, which was really shocking news.
He’s the creator of the innovative software ChatGPT, so it was hard to believe he was removed so suddenly.

According to recent reports, many small and mid-sized venture companies have been closing whenever OpenAI announces new technology related to ChatGPT, because OpenAI’s technology is so advanced and competitive.

Eventually, as many people expected, Sam Altman joined Microsoft for a short time and then returned to OpenAI just a few days later.
It made me realize again how difficult it is to maintain a non-profit model in an industry that’s getting so much global attention.

I’m not sure whether AI will dominate humanity in the future, but I can see that some people are concerned about how fast AI is developing.
It was a very eye-opening news story for me.
