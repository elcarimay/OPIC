## 1. You indicated that you read newspaper in the survey. What is your favorite newspaper? Why do you like reading it?
```
Reading newspaper was one way to obtain information and what the world is like. I love to read newspaper.
The first thing I do when I go to work every morning is to read the news on the company bulletin board.
The in-house communication team collects news from each media company and uploads it to the bulletin board every
 day. Even if I don't have to search, I see all the news in one data, so it helps me a lot to get new news.
I think it's a kind of privilege to work for a company. Read the news and search for areas you want to find out more.
Of course, since I work for a display company, most of the news is mainly related to semiconductors and electronic components.
All I have to do is to read headlines of each section, and choose articles I want to read. By reading them I can clearly
see what is happening and what the differences in perspectives are. Since I can know the situation of our competitors
and objectively grasp the situation of our company, I can indirectly infer whether bonuses will be made at the end of
this year. For your information, the business situation is good this year, so I'm looking forward to the end of the year.

## 2. How were you first interested in reading newspaper? When was it? Were there special reasons? What made you start to read it?
```
I was interested in the news for the first time when I was a new employee. In particular, I was interested in e-newspapers.
Ironically, the company asked me to collect the information of competitors, but they told me not to contact the number of
competitors. They are told not to meet in the purpose of leaking company information and emphasize security thoroughly.
However, there are not many ways to know the information of competitors without meeting them. Indirectly, you can learn
about the situation of competitors through newspapers. Therefore, I think newspaper articles are very important because
they give considerable information to office workers in each company. The problem is that there is so much information
that I think I need some experience to know what information is true and whether it helps me. The proverb that you can
see as much as you know is really true. Now I try to read news articles as I have time.

## 3. Do you have any unforgettable experience when you read newspaper? When was it? What happened? Tell me about it from the beginning to the end.
```
The most memorable news I've seen recently is about openai. A OPENAI CEO named Sam Altman was suddenly fired from the company
overnight. It was by a non-profit board of directors, and it was amazing news. He was the creator of an innovative SW
called CHATGPT, but it was hard to believe that he was suddenly fired from the company. According to recent news, small
and medium-sized venture companies close one by one whenever OPENAI announces new technologies related to CHATGPT. 
Because OPENAI's technology is the best. Eventually, as expected, he decided to enter MS a few days later and returned
to the company. I once again felt that it was difficult to continue as a non-profit in an industry where people's
attention was focused in any field, and I did not know whether ai would dominate mankind, but I could see that there were
people who expressed concern about the development of ai.
