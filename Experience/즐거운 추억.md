```
One of my favortie memories about a good friend in the company was
when we went on a road trip together.
We had been planning it for weeks, and we were both so excited to
explore new places and make memories.
We packed up the car and hit the road early in the morning.
We sang along to our favorite songs, and snacked on junk food, and so on.
