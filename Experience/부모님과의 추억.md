# 아버지와의 추억
```
My father was very strict when I was growing up.
I always had to bow to adults, and I would get scolded if I behaved or spoke rudely.
He wasn’t the most affectionate person, but he was a civil servant and worked hard until he retired.

One day, we went to my grandfather’s house, and I remember he told me never to eat before the adults do.
But I had eaten all the tangerines by myself, and he scolded me a lot for it.
At the time, I felt it was unfair — I didn’t think something like food was such a big deal.

But now that I’m an adult, I understand his point a little better.
It was about respect, manners, and waiting your turn, not just the food.
