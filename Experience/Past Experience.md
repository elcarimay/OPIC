## Have you ever canceled plans because of something unexpected?
```
In general, Campers are sensitive to the weather, so they wake up, turn on the weather app in their cellphone, and
check the today's weather. A year ago, I planned to go camping because I checked the weather a week ago and said
it wouldn't rain on weekends. It was raining little by little when I finished preparing early in the morning
on the day of departure and tried to go out. Still, I thought it would be okay to arrive at the camping site,
so I went to the front of the camping site, which is two hours away. The problem was that it was continuing to
rain at all and eventually returned home. It was a pity that I couldn't camp, but it was comforting to think
that I didn't have to dry the tent in the rain. And next time, I vowed not to go if it rains a little on
the morning of the day.

## Have you ever bought tickets, but couldn't make it because something unexpected happened?
```
Twelve years ago, I booked a ticket to watch a movie with my girlfriend, who is now my wife. At the day of
 screening, I was going to the movie theater, but when I heard that my father was sick, I turned around.
 When I went to my father's house and saw the situation, his ankles overlapped. When I heard the reason,
 he said that he was injured because he hurt his leg incorrectly while going down the stairs after drinking.
 Eventually, the next day, my father wore a cast and had to go to the hospital for a while. It was an
 opportunity to learn once again that drinking is bad.

## What did you do at your last gathering or celebration? What was the occasion?
```
On the morning of the Last Children's day, my family went to the flower garden in Paju in the northern part of Korea.
There were various kinds of flowers and the garden was well decorated, so I was busy taking pictures
with my family. The weather was bad because it rained, but it was good to see flowers because it was indoors.
The color and fragrance of flowers always seem to be healing. Being with many flowers that are usually hard to see,
I felt naturally relieved and healed. It was hard to stop the child buying anything, but it became a  good memory.
And after, we went to the National Museum of korea. There were historical puzzles and souvenirs for children.
It was a happy day to my family.

## Which performance or show did you last watch? When did you watch it and which theater did you go to? What did you do befor and after going to the theater?
```
I watched a movie called Galaxy of Guardians three in the theater on May 4th.
The movie theater is located in Dongtan, hwaseoung city.
Before going to the theater, I had checked the showtimes and bought tickets online.
I had also planned to arrive early to get a good seat and buy some snacks or drinks.
But we couldn't do it because we were late. 
After watching the movie, I had discussed the plot and characters with my son.
I had shared my opinions and favorite scenes from the movie. And I came back at home.

## Please tell me about one of your experiences when you went to the park recently. Give me a full story of what you did from the moment you arrived at the park until you left.
```
I went to the park with my son by bicycle last Sunday. There were soccer fields, basketball courts, etc.
I was worried that the floor would be slippery because of the rain, but I decided to go first. When I arrived,
there was a little water on the floor, but it was fortunate that I couldn't play basketball, and it was so
 good that there were no people. I played basketball for about an hour and a half, and I had so much fun
 exercising with my son. After a while, the students came to exercise, but it was okay because the number was
 small. Maybe because it was autumn, it wasn't hot and the wind blew a little, so I didn't sweat and it was
 perfect for exercising. After 2 hours, came home riding a bicycle. The food we ate after exercising was so
delicious that I could make  a memory with my son.
```
## Please tell me about the most recent concert you went to. What did you do before and after the concert?
```
I was able to go to the concert because the company distributed tickets for classical and Korean traditional
music performances for free. I and my son went to the concert hall in Cheonan City Hall. We ate some food
in the car and entered in time for the performances. It was a fusion jazz performance, and it was so amazing
that the voice alone could produce various tones, and there were many songs that I didn't know what to say,
but I could see that the singer was sincerely enthusiastic through gestures and singing. I don't know, but
I heard she is a famous jazz singer. I feel like a maniac, but I thought it would be nice to hear it sometimes.
My son seemed to be bored, but I hope it will be a good experience in these days is surrounded by fast music.
I was so happy that my son said it was a good performance in the car on the way back.
