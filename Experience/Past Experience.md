## Have you ever canceled plans because of something unexpected?
```
In general, campers are very sensitive to the weather, so they usually wake up, check their weather app, and see what the forecast is for the day.

About a year ago, I planned a camping trip because I had checked the weather a week in advance, and it said there would be no rain on the weekend.
But on the morning of the trip, just after I had finished packing and was getting ready to leave, it started to rain — just a little.

Still, I thought it would be fine by the time I reached the campsite, which was about two hours away.
But the problem was that the rain kept getting worse, and when I arrived at the campsite entrance, it was still raining steadily.
In the end, I had no choice but to turn around and go back home.

It was disappointing that I couldn’t enjoy the trip, but one thing that comforted me was knowing I didn’t have to set up or dry a tent in the rain.
After that experience, I promised myself that if it rains even a little on the morning of the trip, I’ll just cancel it next time.

## Have you ever bought tickets, but couldn't make it because something unexpected happened?
```
About twelve years ago, I booked movie tickets to watch a film with my girlfriend — who is now my wife.
On the day of the screening, I was on my way to the theater when I suddenly got a call saying that my father was sick.
So I immediately turned around and went to his house.

When I got there, I saw that his ankles were swollen and overlapping strangely.
He told me that he had injured his leg after falling down the stairs while going home drunk.
Apparently, he misstepped and hurt himself badly.

The next day, he had to wear a cast and go to the hospital for treatment.
It was a serious situation, but thankfully, he recovered well.

That experience reminded me once again of how dangerous drinking can be, and it really left a strong impression on me.

## What did you do at your last gathering or celebration? What was the occasion?
```
On the morning of last Children's Day, my family visited a flower garden in Paju, in the northern part of Korea.
The garden was beautifully decorated and full of various kinds of flowers, so I was busy taking pictures with my family.

The weather wasn’t great because it was raining, but luckily the garden was indoors, so we could still enjoy the flowers.
The colors and fragrance of the flowers felt really healing.
Being surrounded by so many beautiful flowers — ones we don’t usually get to see — helped me relax and feel at peace.

Of course, it was a bit hard to stop my child from wanting to buy everything, but in the end, it became a fun and special memory.

After that, we went to the National Museum of Korea.
There were historical puzzles and souvenirs for children, which made the experience even more fun for my son.

It was truly a happy day for our whole family.

## Which performance or show did you last watch? When did you watch it and which theater did you go to? What did you do befor and after going to the theater?
```
I watched a movie called Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 at a theater in Dongtan, Hwaseong City on May 4th.
Before going to the theater, I checked the showtimes and bought the tickets online in advance.
I had also planned to arrive early to get good seats and buy some snacks and drinks.

But unfortunately, we were running late, so we couldn’t do any of that.

After the movie, I talked with my son about the plot and the characters.
We shared our opinions and favorite scenes, and it was fun to hear his thoughts too.
Once the conversation was over, we headed back home.

## Please tell me about one of your experiences when you went to the park recently. Give me a full story of what you did from the moment you arrived at the park until you left.
```
I went to the park with my son by bicycle last Sunday.
The park had soccer fields, basketball courts, and more.
Since it had rained earlier, I was a bit worried that the ground might be slippery, but we decided to go anyway.

When we arrived, there was a little water on the ground, so unfortunately, we couldn’t play basketball right away.
But actually, it turned out to be a good thing — there weren’t many people around, so we had the place almost to ourselves.
We ended up playing basketball for about an hour and a half, and I had such a great time exercising with my son.

After a while, a few students showed up to exercise too, but it wasn’t crowded at all.
Maybe because it was autumn, the weather was perfect — it wasn’t hot, and there was a nice breeze, so I didn’t sweat much.
It really felt like an ideal day for outdoor activities.

After about two hours, we rode our bikes back home.
The food we had after all that exercise tasted amazing, and I felt happy to have created a special memory with my son.
```
## Please tell me about the most recent concert you went to. What did you do before and after the concert?
```
I was able to go to a concert because my company gave out free tickets for classical and Korean traditional music performances.
I went with my son to the concert hall at Cheonan City Hall.

We ate some food in the car before the show and made it just in time for the performance.
It turned out to be a fusion jazz performance, and I was really amazed by it.
The singer was able to create so many different tones with just her voice, and even though there were some songs I didn’t quite understand,
I could clearly feel her passion through her gestures and the way she sang.

I heard she’s actually a famous jazz singer — I’m not really familiar with jazz, but I thought it would be nice to listen to this kind of music once in a while.
My son seemed a little bored during the performance, but I still hope it was a meaningful experience for him, especially since most music these days is so fast and digital.

On the way home, he told me in the car that it was a good performance, and I felt so happy to hear that.
