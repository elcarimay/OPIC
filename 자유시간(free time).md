# Tell me about the last time you had some free time. When was it? What did you do?
```
I had been busy with work during the week, so I was looking forward to a chance to relax and do something fun.
On Saturday morning, I slept in a bit and then had a relaxed breakfast at home. Afterward,
I decided to go for a walk in a nearby park to enjoy the fresh air and exercise. While I was there,
I met up with a neighborhood who was also out for a walk, and I chatted for a while before continuing on my ways.
In the afternoon, I went to a movie theater to see a new release that I had been looking forward to. After the movie,
I stopped at a caf√© to grab a coffee and talk with my family.
On Sunday, I decided to pursue one of my hobbies and spent several hours practicing piano.
Later in the day, I went to a restaurant with my family for a nice dinner.
Overall, I enjoyed a relaxing weekend with a lot of activities and time with my family.

# How did you spend your free time when you were a child? What did you do?
```
When I was a child, I might have spent time playing soccer in a school ground with my friends. I might have also
enjoyed playing video games or watching television.
Some friend might have taken up hobbies like playing a musical instrument, drawing or painting, or practicing a martial art.
They might have attended lessons or classes to improve their skills in these areas.
I also often spend time with my families, going on trips or participating in family activities. For example, I might have
gone on a picnic, visited a museum or cultural site, or watched a movie together.
Overall, while I do face academic pressure, I also have plenty of opportunities for fun and creative activities in my free time.
