## Q1) I'd like to know about how recycling is practiced in your country. What do people specifically do? Tell me how things are recycled.
```
Recycling? Hmm, Yeah, it's a pretty big deal here in Korea. I'm sure about that. It's because recycling policy  
is very strict here in Korea. And if they don't do it, people have to pay fine / penalty!  
So what people do is .. they separate plastics bottles, papers, cans and glasses. Because these items are  
recyclable. In my case, I usually take them out twice a week on average. Yeah, I think doing this every day  
is such a hassle and people are busy anyway.. that's way I do this occasionally but you know?  
Some people don't care about recycling but I believe this is very important thing to do. Because recycling  
can save the earth as we practice these small things.. otherwise, we will have to pay find, which is not so  
fun. Not only that, but it can be harmful to our environment. Yeah, I think recycling is practiced well so far.  
That's all how recycling works in Korea. / That's all about recycling here in my country / Korea.
```
## Q2) Now, tell me how you personally recycle. Do you separate the recycling every day? Where do you take out the recycling to? Tell me everything about the ways you practice recycling in your daily life.
```
How do I recycle? well, As I told you, I can't take the garbage out everyday but once or twice a week.  
And there is a separated trash can at my home .. one is for paper, another is for plastic, the other is  
for cans .. as I have separate when I throw trashes, recycling is such a piece of cake to me. If you don't  
use this, I strongly recommend you to do that! Honestly, I didn't care much about recycling in the past.  
However, as time passes by.. I care more about the environment than before. Also, air pollution is a serious  
problem here in Korea, so I think this is a critical step to follow. Also, I try not to use plastic bag~  
For example, when I go to the grocery stores, I usually carry reusable shopping bag so I don't need to buy  
any plactic bag .. it costs extra money and very harmful to this environment. So I don't use plastic bags  
anymore. Yeah, I think that's how I recycle.
```
## Q3) Tell me about a memorable or unexpected incident regarding recycling. What exactly happened and how  
did you deal with the situation? Tell me everything that you do from beginning to end.
```
Well.. memorable incident regarding recycling? And let me tell you what happened. I remember taking out recycling  
two weeks ago. I tried to carry the recycling items out to the dumpster and I also had some food waste, too.  
As I live on 22th floor, I had to take the elevator. In the elevator, I smelled something terrible and I dropped  
the plastic bag and inside the elevator smelled terrible and I had to clean up all the mess. I was not the only  
one inside elevator, so I had to apologize to my neighbors even though I tried to clean completely, the small  
of food was still in the elevator. Since then, every time I take out garbage, especially food trash, I double  
check if plastic bag is broken or not. So I can't forget about this.
```
## Q4) How is recycling you practice when you were different from what you do today? Are there any big differences? Are there any similarities? Tell me about how recycling has changed over the years.
```
Well.. In differences in recycling? As I remember, a long time ago when I was a little kid, Koreans didn't  
recycle at all.. I know .. it's a shame but people used to throw things into one big plastic trash bag. They  
put everything together like plastic, paper, glasses and even food trash. Because we didn't have any recycling  
policy and people didn't care much about the environment so a huge amount of trash used to be a significant  
social problem. Moreover, maybe in early 90's my government decided to sell trash bags..it was started to reduce  
the amount of trash coming from households and restaurant. At first, most people complained because they didn't  
think it was necessary. Also, a new trash bag was pricey compared old ones. Now, nobody can't imagine putting  
everything together in one trash bag. They have to separate recyclable things to avoid paying fine. And recycling  
became a daily routine so people are very used to it. I think these are the changes regarding recycling. 
```
## Q5) Tell me about something that you heard or read about recycling in the news recently. What was it about? What is being done to address that issue? Give me all the details about that issue on recycling.
```
Any news I heard about recycling? Yeah, let me tell you what I heard. You might be aware of this.. yeah, Korean people  
love to dring coffee, and the news is about disposable coffee cups. The thins is coffee shops are not allowed to use  
paper of plastic coffee cups except to go orders. And if the coffee shop serves drinks with this kind of container,  
they will have to pay fine up to $2,000. It's because too many disposable items are used recklessly and it's been a  
big problem. As I heard, it started last month so coffee shops stopped serving drinks using these items. And I think  
it's great policy to reduce trash and save the earth. You know .. plastic cups and paper cups will take forever to be  
composed, Also, these kind of containers release environment hormones, so it causes serious health and environment problems  
Anyway, this is the recent news I heard about recycling.
