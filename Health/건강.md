## Q1) I'd like to ask you to describe a healthy person you know of. What makes that person health? Why do you think so? Tell me about the things you think make someone healthy.
```
Certainly, let me tell you about my wife, who is exceptionally health-conscious. She maintains her health
 by adhering to a strict dietary regimen, prioritizing whole and nutritious foods while avoiding
 carbohydrates. Her meals often consist of salads paired with grilled chicken or salmon, steering clear
 of fatty and greasy junk food. In addition to her healthy eating habits, she engages in pilates twice
 a week, a choice influenced by her busy work schedule. To complement her lifestyle, she abstains from
 alcohol, preferring nutritional supplements for her overall well-being. These conscious choices and her
 commitment to regular exercise contribute significantly to her excellent health.

## Q2) What are some things you have tried personally to stay health?
```
To stay healthy, I have tried to many thing. I have tried playing table tennis and push-up. Actually going to the gym
on the regular basis was never easy for me, so I take a walk to the park nearby my place and it's been pretty awesome
to me. Hmm.. Honestly I believe health diet is more important than exercise. Even though people spend lots of time at
the gym, if they don't eat properly, their efforts go down to the drain. And that's what happened to me. And I try not
to forget to take health supplements like multi-vitamins and omega 3. Yeah, that's all I have tried to stay healthy.
```
## Q3) Tell me about somethinig that you tried for your health and turned out to be effective. What did you do and what kind of effects did it have on your health? Give me all the details.
```
To stay healthy, I have tried various things over the years. Among them, eating health was one of the most  
effective way to stay healthy. I have tried to avoid eating junk food but eat healthy like vegetables and fruits.  
I have got a confess something. A few years ago, I drank too much. I felt sick and sometimes I lost my memory.
A year ago I decided I couldn't stay like this and quit drinking for health. And I played table tennis every lunch
time at work and went to the park with my son on weekends. I feel much healthier than before. Yeah, healthy diet and
regular exercise have been the most effective thing I have done so far. These are things I do to stay healthy.
```
## Q4) Something wrong can happen to our health sometimes. What are some problems we can have? Describe in detail what can happen when someone loses his/her health. How can a health problem be fixed?
```
Well.. There are many health problem we can have actually and there is one famous Korean old saying.  
If you lose your health, you lose all your fortune. And I agree with this statement.  
Actually, health is the most important thing in terms of well-being but many people don't realize how  
important it can be. And you know what? Actually regular medical check-up is a very crucial part as people  
get physical exam to find out any disease they might have. Anyway, one of the most common health problems  
in Korea is a cancer.. I guess.. and many people suffer or lose their life after diagnosed. It's not easy,
but I think reducing stress and eating healthy and exercising is the way to get out of the mentioned disease.
```
## Q5) Now, tell me how your parents' generation used to manintain their health in the past.
```
In the past, people were not that health conscious. I mean they knew healthy lifestyle is important but work  
was more important than anything else. So they had a long working hours but didn't take care of their health  
that much. But now.. pepole have become a lot more health-conscious that in the past. and smoking culture is  
one of biggest changes. For example, many people quit smoking and even indoor-smoking is not allowed any more.  
I never experienced but I heard some people used to smoke at their office and second-hand smoking was a big  
social problem. Korea government decided to prohibit smoking in public area. So it was a big controversial(논란이 많은)
but I believe it's been going well. And also, more people try to exercise at the parks or gym as they spare time
to stay healthy. I believe these are great changes. People are aware of importance of health and working out  
brings lots of health benefits. I think these two things are the biggest changes.
```
## Q6) What are some issues related our health in the news these days?
```
Some social issues related to health? I hear about that all the time because health is one of the most important  
things in life. And many people also suffer from different kinds of diseases like cancer, diabets, hypertension  
and much more. Since I'm very interested in health, I like to watch medical TV programs and I found out one thing.  
All of these diseases come from stress. Nowadays, most Koreans suffer from stress. And it cause lots of health  
problems. Actually, doctors recommend regular exercise and healthy diet helps to reduce level of stress.  
Korean have a long working hours compared to other developed countries and it's well-known fact. So many Koreans  
are stressed out from their job or fierce competitions actually. people need to find a way to release stress and stay healthy.
