## Q1) I'd like to ask you to describe a healthy person you know of. What makes that person health? Why do you think so? Tell me about the things you think make someone healthy.
```
Well .. Health person? Let me tell you about my friend who is really healthy. Actually she is very health-conscious  
so she tries to eat healthy and eat regularly.. also she tries to cut off carb(hydrates) as much as she can.  
As I know, she always eats salads with a grilled chicken or salmon. And she tries to avoid to eat junk food  
which is usually fatty and greasy. In addition, she also goes to the park to wall .. about 4 or 5 days a week.  
Since she's been busy at work and doesn't have enough time to exercise. That's why she decided to take a walk  
since it's not that hard to start. One last thing is a positive attitude. I think this plays a big role. Maybe  
it's the most important to maintain healthy. Because people who have a positive mindset, usually have lower  
stress and healthy. Yeah, that's all about her who is healthy that I know.
```
## Q2) What are some things you have tried personally to stay health?
```
To stay healthy, I have tried to many thing. I have tried pilates/personal training / yoga/walking/hiking and  
many other things. Actually going to the gym on the regular basis was never easy for me, so I wasted my money  
pretty much and one time, I took yoga class because my friend asked me to join her. However, it was kinda boring  
to me. I kinda wanted to do something more exciting, so after I tried many other things, I just decided to take  
a walk which is easy and doesn't cost any money. Since then, I take a walk to the park nearby my place and it's  
been pretty awesome to me. Hmm.. Honestly I believe health diet is more important than exercise. Even though  
people spend lots of time at the gym, if they don't eat properly, their efforts go down to the drain. And that's  
what happened to me. And I try not to forget to take health supplements like multi-vitamins and omega 3. Yeah,  
that's all I have tried to stay healthy.
```
## Q3) Tell me about somethinig that you tried for your health and turned out to be effective. What did you do and what kind of effects did it have on your health? Give me all the details.
```
To stay healthy, I have tried various things over the years. Among them, eating health was one of the most  
effective way to stay healthy. I have tried to avoid eating junk food but eat healthy like vegetables and fruits.  
I gotta confess something. Before, used to eat lots of McDonals, so my nick name was a burger prince. In  
the past, I could sleep after I eat one cheese burger even though I was not hungry. And I gained about 15 kg  
after that. And I decided to lose weight after. So after trying many kind of thing, I realized eating healthy  
works the best. I went to the park to take a walk 4 or 5 times a week and it has been the most helpful.  
I started walking about 2 years ago so it's been a while since I started walking and I feel much healthier  
than before. Yeah, healthy diet and regular exercise have been the most effective thing I have done so far.  
These are things I do to stay healthy.

## Q4) Something wrong can happen to our health sometimes. What are some problems we can have? Describe in detail what can happen when someone loses his/her health. How can a health problem be fixed?
```
Well.. There are many health problem we can have actually and there is one famous Korean old saying.  
If you lose your health, you lose all your fortune. And I agree with this statement.  
Actually, health is the most important thing in terms of welll-being but many people don't realize how  
important it can be. And you know what? Actually regular medical check-up is a very crucial part as people  
get physical exam to find out any disease they might have. Anyway, one of the most common health problems  
in Korea is a cancer.. I guess.. and many people suffer or lose their life after diagnosed.
```
## Q5) Now, tell me how your parents' generation used to manintain their health in the past.
```
In the past, people were not that health conscious. I mean they knew healthy lifestyle is important but work  
was more important than anything else so they had a long working hours but didn't take care of their health  
that much. But now.. pepole have become a lot more health-conscious that in the past. and smoking culture is  
one of biggest changes. For example, many people quit smoking and even indoor-smoking is not allowed any more.  
I never experienced but I heard some people used to smoke at their office and second-hand smoking was a big  
social problem. As I remember, Korea government decided to prohibit smoking in public area also. So it was  
a big controversial(논란이 많은) but I believe it's been going well. Also, more people try to exercise at the parks  
or gym as they spare time to stay healthy. I believe these are great changes since .. People are aware of  
importance of health and working ouit brings lots of health benefits. I think these two things are the biggest  
changes.
```
## Q6) What are some issues related our health in the news these days?
```
Some social issues related to health? I hear about that all the time because health is one of the most important  
things in life. And many people also suffer from different kinds of diseases like cancer, diabets, hypertension  
and much more. Since I'm very interested in health, I like to watch medical TV programs and I found out one thing.  
All of these diseases come from stress. Nowadays, most Koreans suffer from stress. And it cause lots of health  
problems. Actually, doctors recommend regular exercise and healthy diet helps to reduce level of stress.  
Korean have a long working hours compared to other developed countries and it's well-known fact. So many Koreans  
are stressed out actually. people need to find a way to release stress and stay healthy.
