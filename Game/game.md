## 1) You responded that you enjoy playing games. What kinds of games do you like to play? How often do you play games? When and where do you normally play games? With whom do you like to play?
```
I usually play games that are available on my smart phone. There are all kinds of games we can
download from app store. Even better!! Most of games I enjoy are free of charge. I usually choose to
play puzzle games. The primary reason for me to enjoy such kinds of games is that they are easy to
play. I cannot play games that need strategies. That is why I am not familiar with any role playing
games or war games. I usually play the game whenever I have time and places are usually not a
matter. Since I have spare time between my classes/work I like to play games just for 20 minutes. I
usually play games by myself. Some games using a smart phone can be connected to internet.
Therefore I am able to play games with others even though they are not right beside me. Playing a
game is the best way to spend time so far.

## 2) Let’s talk about your favorite game. Can you tell me the rules of the game? Tell me how to play it in detail
```
I mentioned that I like to play puzzle games. But recently I have drawn to old board games. When I
was young I used to play board games with my sisters spending hours. About 2 months ago, I found
out that I could play the board game with my smart phone. Ever since I downloaded the game, I have
been playing it every day. You may have heard of it. It is Monopoly. It has the same rules, the same
board and the same excitement. It is the board game that allows players to buy the cities in the world
with its fake money. Up to 4 players can play it. Players move by rolling 2 dices. If 2 dices show the
same number, a player can roll them again and moves further. Each column represents cities and once
a player arrives at the column first, he can buy the city as well as build hotels and houses to increase
its property value. If the other players arrive at the city, they have to pay to pass it. Until three of the
plays are bankrupt, or one player stands alone, the game ends. It is easy and fun. I would love to
recommend the game to you.

## 3) How and when were you interested in playing games? What game did you lie to play at that time? How did you learn to play the game? Tell me all the details
```
I was not interested in playing any kinds of games. I thought playing a game was not good
because of my father. My father told me that playing a game was waste of time and that I had to
focus on other things. It was actually my mother who influenced me. When I was 12 years old, my
mother asked father to get her a game console for her birthday. My father was probably very puzzled
when she asked so because he believed that playing a game was useless. But my father always says
yes to my mother. She got her birthday gift. Ever since she got her game console, we played several
games together. I realized that it was really fun way to spend time. I have been playing games for fun
since she taught me how to operate a game controller. Still my mother’s biggest hobby is playing
games with her smart phone. I think it is great hobby if you are able to control yourself.
