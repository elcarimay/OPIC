## 1) You responded that you enjoy playing games. What kinds of games do you like to play? How often do you play games? When and where do you normally play games? With whom do you like to play?
```
I usually play games that are available on my smart phone. There are all kinds of games we can
download from app store. Even better!! Most of games I enjoy are free of charge. 
In the past, I used to play my favorite games, but now I play my son's favorite games. My son likes
team games, and he especially likes to play a game called Brawl Stars with me. The game is so simple and
easy to play that you can play with anyone of all ages. Up to five teams can play the game, and the winning rate
seems to be about 30%. Of course, it is connected to the Internet and can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere regardless
of location. The problem is that my son is trying to do too much, so it's better to control it properly, so I always
set a time. I want my son to learn the habit of playing games properly.

## 2) Letâ€™s talk about your favorite game. Can you tell me the rules of the game? Tell me how to play it in detail
```
I mentioned that I like to play board games. I used to play board games with my family spending hours. It was a game
called Blue Marble, which travels around the world to build buildings and charge tolls. There are villas, buildings,
and hotels in the building, which are plastic models and realistic because they use bills.
First, spread the board in the middle and sit around to decide what to say. And if there is land in a country where
we can buy it by moving the dice according to the number we rolled, we can buy it and build a building on the land
we bought. When someone comes to my land, I have to build a lot of buildings because I can get tolls depending on
the number of buildings. The problem is that it costs a lot of money to build a building, so I have to take out
a loan from a bank. There is also land where buildings cannot be built, but such land is expensive to purchase
and toll. Anyway, the game ends when someone goes bankrupt while playing the game like this. There is an event
called the golden key in the middle and it is a very interesting game. The problem is that once we start, it
takes at least two hours, so it's not easy to start. However, I often enjoy it with my family because of high
satisfaction.

## 3) How and when were you interested in playing games? What game did you lie to play at that time? How did you learn to play the game? Tell me all the details
```
When I was in middle and high school, I played a lot of PC games. Maybe I solved the stress of my studies by playing
games. I played a lot of role-playing games, but as I sympathized with the characters in the game, it was fun to hunt
monsters, make money, strengthen weapons, and buy powerful armor. The problem was, she didn't like games very much and I
heard from my mother that games are a useless time and don't help my life at all, but at that time I was too young to
know the meaning. I played a lot of games even after I got married, but in the early days of my honeymoon, my wife
scolded me a lot. However, as time goes by and I get older, fortunatly, my interest in games naturally decreases, and
now I only play games when my son asks me to play them. Games were a good way to spend time in my youth, but it was
difficult to control them properly, and I'm glad I don't play games even now. These days, I am worried about how to
teach my son how to control the time to play games.
