## 1) You responded that you enjoy playing games. What kinds of games do you like to play? How often do you play games? When and where do you normally play games? With whom do you like to play?

I usually play games on my smartphone.
These days, there are all kinds of games you can download from the app store, and even better — most of the games I enjoy are free!

In the past, I used to play my own favorite games, but these days, I mostly play the games my son likes.
He enjoys team games, and his favorite is a game called Brawl Stars, which we often play together.

The game is really simple and easy to play, so people of all ages can enjoy it.
Up to five teams can join each match, and I think the winning rate is around 30%.
Since it’s connected to the internet, we can play it anytime and anywhere.

The only problem is that my son sometimes plays too much, so I make sure to set time limits for him.
I think it’s important for him to learn how to enjoy games in a healthy and balanced way.

## 2) Let’s talk about your favorite game. Can you tell me the rules of the game? Tell me how to play it in detail
```
As I mentioned earlier, I enjoy playing board games.
I used to spend hours playing them with my family, especially a game called Blue Marble.
It’s a game where you travel around the world, buy land, build properties, and charge tolls.
You can build villas, buildings, and hotels, and the game uses plastic models and fake bills, which makes it feel quite realistic.

To start the game, we spread the board in the middle and sit around it.
Then, we roll the dice and move according to the number we get.
If we land on a country where the land is available, we can buy it and build on it.
When another player lands on land that I own, I can charge them a toll — and the more buildings I have, the higher the toll.

The tricky part is that building costs a lot of money, so sometimes we have to take out loans from the bank.
There are also some lands where you can’t build anything, but they are expensive and the tolls are still high.

The game continues until one player goes bankrupt, and along the way, there’s also an event system called the Golden Key, which adds more excitement.

The only downside is that it takes at least two hours to finish one game, so it’s not always easy to start.
But overall, I really enjoy playing it with my family because it’s fun and satisfying every time.

## 3) How and when were you interested in playing games? What game did you lie to play at that time? How did you learn to play the game? Tell me all the details
```
When I was in middle and high school, I played a lot of PC games.
Looking back, I think I used games as a way to relieve the stress from studying.
I especially enjoyed role-playing games, and I found it really fun to hunt monsters, earn money, upgrade weapons, and buy powerful armor.
As I got more involved in the stories, I started to connect emotionally with the characters, which made the games even more exciting.

However, not everyone around me understood my interest.
My mother often told me that playing games was a waste of time and wouldn’t help me in life.
But at the time, I was too young to fully understand what she meant.

Even after getting married, I continued to play games, and in the early days of my honeymoon, my wife scolded me quite a bit for it.
Thankfully, as I got older, my interest in gaming naturally decreased, and now I only play games occasionally when my son asks me to join him.

In the end, I think games were a fun part of my youth, but they were also difficult to control.
I’m actually relieved that I don’t play them as much anymore.
These days, my biggest concern is how to teach my son to enjoy games in moderation and develop healthy habits.
