→ People may have different standards for having a lot of money, and I think lowering those standards can make them happy.  
  
## 69. Do you think a leader should be feared or liked?  
→ There is no need to be afraid of a leader, but I think a leader should have some authority.  
This is because if a leader does not have authority, no one will follow any decision.  
And However, when having a meeting, the leader must give up authority so that people can freely share their opinions.   Therefore, sometimes a leader should be friendly.  
## 70. What problems have you encountered at work?  
→ In fact, I don't have any special problems. However, as I get older, the time to maintain concentration seems to have decreased due to decreased physical strength.  
## 71. What was the biggest professional risk you have taken and what was the outcome?  
→ Due to the nature of the work of sitting in front of the computer for a long time, bad posture can lead to poor health. So, I play table tennis with my colleagues every lunchtime. And I try to work in the right posture whenever I have time.  
## 72. How do you ensure all of your work gets accomplished in a productive manner?  
→ Of course, meetings should be reduced and the time to write reports should be reduced. In addition, the computer program execution time should be reduced by changing the computer to the latest one.  
## 73. How have you changed in the last five years?  
→ In the past, I had to leave work quickly and do housework because of childcare, but now I have no problem even if my child grows up and leaves work late. I get allowance from my wife every month, but I get extra money for overtime work. So I'm trying to make more money by working overtime.  
## 74. How much do you expect to get paid?  
→ I think I get enough money from the company. In Korean society, money is made from real estate or stocks, but the company's salary does not make much money. So I don't have high expectations for the salary I get from the company. 
Everyone is trying to receive an allotment for an apartment, and I have also been living for five years after receiving
that.
## 75. What is your greatest weakness? What are you doing to improve it?

## 76. What aspect of supervision do you find the most difficult?

## 77. There's no right or wrong answer, but if you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you do?

## 78. What was the most important task you ever had?  
→ I think every moment is always important because they always come to me when there is a problem rather than a particularly important thing. The problem is that no matter how much experience I have, I don't know everything, so it takes a lot of time to googling data and find solutions for some problems I don't know.     
## 79. How many square feet of pizza are eaten in the United States each month?  
→ Suppose that the population of the United States is about 300 million, and about 200 million of them eat pizza. The area of a pizza with a diameter of 0.3m is about 0.28 m2(square meter), and assuming that it eats about 25% per person, the area per person is about 0.07m2. So, 200 million times 0.07 is 14 million m2.
