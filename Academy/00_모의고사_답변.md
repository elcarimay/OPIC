1.1 자주가는 영화관?
Well...There is a movie theater near my house. Which is a huge. And in  
my case, on the way, there is a bakery, that is famous for salted bread  
and I'm a regular there. So when I visit there, I buy some salted bread  
and I get some coffee from self service coffee shop, and then there is  
a bench near the movie theater. So, I just sit down, space out, have the  
salted bread and coffee that I bought and watch people who pass by me.  
Then it itself is a healing to me. And then I go to the movie theater.
1-2. 어떤 종류의 영화?
Well... you know.. Actually I love all kind of movies because they're all
fun and interesting. But if I have to just tell you one thing that I like
among them. I would say sci-fi movies is my favorite. Because you know...
actually it's spectacular and it's very amazing. 
1-3. 영화관이나 영화에 대한 특별경험?
Well...memorable experience about the movie. Um...well let me see.
About [twelve years]ago, I was trying to watch a movie with my family. 
On the day of the screening, I was on my way to the theater when I suddenly
got a call that my father was sick. So I immediately turned around and went
to his house. When I got there, I saw that his ankles were swollen and
overlapping which looked strange. He told me that he had injured his leg
after falling down the stairs while going home drunk.
Well…apparently, he misstepped and hurt himself badly.
So The next day, he had to go to the hospital for treatment and wear a cast.
It was a serious situation, but thankfully, he recovered well.
Well.. anyway That experience reminded me of how dangerous drinking is,
and it really left a strong impression on me.
1-4. 영화보기전후 하는일?
But there’s one thing I do every day.
It’s taking care of my small pets. I have 16 of them, and I’ve been raising
them for about 3 or 4 years. Actually, my wife doesn’t really like them.
She doesn’t even come into the room where they are, so I have to take care
of everything. What I mean is, I wake up early in the morning, check on them,
and do some simple cleaning. Of course, I also take care of them at night
before going to bed. So from the moment I open my eyes until I close them,
I’m always looking after my pets.
Before I do 00, there’s nothing special except taking care of my lizards.
After that, I do 00—that’s it.
1-5. 영화를 맨처음 봤을때의 경험?
Well...the first time, movie... my favorite movie?
well...let me see...actually I wasn't interested in music, especially
sci-fi movie genre.
but after I entered my company, I wanted to experience a new things, unusual things
when I liked.
Five years ago, I found some information related to sci-fi movie while searching
the internet.
And as I kept analyzing that information, I got to know more about sci-fi movies
and became interested, which is why I tried watching the sci-fi movie.
And then, you know...I felt like it was a total new experience.
It was interesting and it was really fun. So, since then I've been still enjoying
sci-fi movie, but not as passionate as before. Well...anyway, that was my first time.
1-6. 영화배우
Um well my favorite actor...Actually I don't know.
But if I have to tell you one person that I know among them,
then, I would say Tom cruise. he is my favorite actor, I think.
Because he is humorous and has wit, but also he is in great shape,
From what I know about him, I mean he does his best in exercising.
well...Speaking of exercise, actually I like exercise, too.
Well...I usually do exersize when I get stressed out, because I can  
relieve stress. But, actually I'm not the type of person who gets  
stressed, because I'm very optimistic and positive.  
I mean I try to think positively all the time, but you know...I'm
a human being. So, Somtimes I get stressed, in that case, I just do
exersize which is really good.  
Anyway, Tom cruize is a good actor, I think.
