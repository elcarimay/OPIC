1.1 자주가는 영화관?
Well...There is a movie theater near my house. Which is a huge. And in  
my case, on the way, there is a bakery, that is famous for salted bread  
and I'm a regular there. So when I visit there, I buy some salted bread  
and I get some coffee from self service coffee shop, and then there is  
a bench near the movie theater. So, I just sit down, space out, have the  
salted bread and coffee that I bought and watch people who pass by me.  
Then it itself is a healing to me. And then I go to the movie theater.

Well... you know.. Actually I love all kind of movies because they're all
fun and interesting. But if I have to just tell you one thing that I like
among them. I would say sci-fi movies is my favorite. Because you know...
actually it's spectacular and it's very amazing. 
1-3. 영화관이나 영화에 대한 특별경험?
Well...memorable experience about the movie. Um...well let me see.
About [twelve years]ago, I was trying to watch a movie with my family. 
On the day of the screening, I was on my way to the theater when I suddenly
got a call that my father was sick. So I immediately turned around and went
to his house. When I got there, I saw that his ankles were swollen and
overlapping which looked strange. He told me that he had injured his leg
after falling down the stairs while going home drunk.
Well…apparently, he misstepped and hurt himself badly.
So The next day, he had to go to the hospital for treatment and wear a cast.
It was a serious situation, but thankfully, he recovered well.
Well.. anyway That experience reminded me of how dangerous drinking is,
and it really left a strong impression on me.
1-4. 영화보기전후 하는일?
But there’s one thing I do every day.
It’s taking care of my small pets. I have 16 of them, and I’ve been raising
them for about 3 or 4 years. Actually, my wife doesn’t really like them.
She doesn’t even come into the room where they are, so I have to take care
of everything. What I mean is, I wake up early in the morning, check on them,
and do some simple cleaning. Of course, I also take care of them at night
before going to bed. So from the moment I open my eyes until I close them,
I’m always looking after my pets.
Before I do 00, there’s nothing special except taking care of my lizards.
After that, I do 00—that’s it.

Well...I usually do exersize when I get stressed out, because I can  
relieve stress. But, actually I'm not the type of person who gets  
stressed, because I'm very optimistic and positive.

a human being. So, Somtimes I get stressed, in that case, I just do
exersize which is really good.  
Anyway, Tom cruize is a good actor, I think.

Well...concert?? last time?? ...um...two weeks ago, I planned to watch a rock 
ballard concert with my family. and actually I arrived at the park, first.
Because the concert was very famous and moreover there were tons of people.
So, I had to wait in line in advance.
What I'm saying is..the start of the concert was at 5 pm, but I got there
at 11 am. to wait. And the worst thing was that all of my skin got burned since
it was outdoor. So, as a result, after the concert, I bought a cream for sunburn
and applied it all over my arms and legs. And you know?
Now my skin started peeling off. Which makes me itchy all over my body.
Anyway the concert was fun and great and it was very unusual experience.
