Um well my favorite actor...Actually I don't know.
But if I have to tell you one person that I know among them,
then, I would say Tom cruise.
he is my favorite actor, I think.
Because he is humorous and has wit, but also he is in great shape,
From what I know about him, I mean he does his best in exercising.
well...Speaking of exercise, actually I like exercise, too. + 육하원칙
Anyway, Tom cruize is a good actor, I think.

I mean I directly went to the store and selected one that I liked.
Which was really really good. which is really nice. 
Whenever I watch TV on the new sofa, I feel so nice.
Actually, you know... It's one of my favorite hobbies. + 육하원칙
Anyway, the new sofa is really nice. I love it.
