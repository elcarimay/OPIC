### 1) 인물묘사
```
음…  well actually I don’t know…. 근데 if I had to tell you one person that I like among them,
I would say [이름] (이 내 favorite 00/ he is 00)  
왜냐면 그는 유머러스하고 위트있고 그리고 몸이 되게 좋아 – 내가 알기로는 운동을 열심히 한대   
……Speaking of 운동,  나도 사실 운동을 좋아해 + 육하원칙 1-2개  
어쨌든 [이름]은 좋은 00인 것 같아

Um well my favorite actor...Actually I don't know.
But if I have to tell you one person that I know among them,
then, I would say Tom cruise.
he is my favorite actor, I think.
Because he is humorous and has wit, but also he is in great shape,
From what I know about him, I mean he does his best in exercising.
well...Speaking of exercise, actually I like exercise, too. + 육하원칙
Anyway, Tom cruize is a good actor, I think.
