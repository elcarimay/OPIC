Oh my, that was such a long time ago.
Honestly, I don't remember the very first time, but I can tell you about an old memory of
going to the theater.
I must have been about 11 years old, and I remember my dad was so excited about a new
movie coming out, but my mom refused to see it.
I think it was too violent for her or something.
One day my father picked me up from school.
He said I didn't have to go to my piano lesson that day because he had a special plan for us.
First, he took me out for ice cream.
Then we went and watched the movie.
It was just a popcorn movie.
This story wasn't very good, but the action was so exciting.
Since then, action movies have been my favorite movie genre.
I still often go to the movies with my dad to watch action movies.

3-1. 얼마나 자주, 어떤종류?
I like music regardless of the genre.
I especially love listening to dance as it's rhythmic.
It has a fast beat and it's so exciting that it often gets me in the mood for dancing.
My favorite song at the moment is Size Kung Num Style.
I love his powerful song and dance moves.
His performances are always unique and it makes me wonder how he comes up with his addictive
choreography.
I listen to music a lot, but I always listen to music when I get ready for work in the
morning.
I like to start my day with a lot of energy.
On my way to work, I check my schedule while listening to music.
Music is like a wondrous remedy for me.
When I'm tired, it relaxes me and when I'm down, it cheers me up.
