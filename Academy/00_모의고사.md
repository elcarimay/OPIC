Oh my, that was such a long time ago.
Honestly, I don't remember the very first time, but I can tell you about an old memory of
going to the theater.
I must have been about 11 years old, and I remember my dad was so excited about a new
movie coming out, but my mom refused to see it.
I think it was too violent for her or something.
One day my father picked me up from school.
He said I didn't have to go to my piano lesson that day because he had a special plan for us.
First, he took me out for ice cream.
Then we went and watched the movie.
It was just a popcorn movie.
This story wasn't very good, but the action was so exciting.
Since then, action movies have been my favorite movie genre.
I still often go to the movies with my dad to watch action movies.

3-1. 얼마나 자주, 어떤종류의 음악?
I like music regardless of the genre.
I especially love listening to dance as it's rhythmic.
It has a fast beat and it's so exciting that it often gets me in the mood for dancing.
My favorite song at the moment is Size Kung Num Style.
I love his powerful song and dance moves.
His performances are always unique and it makes me wonder how he comes up with his addictive
choreography.
I listen to music a lot, but I always listen to music when I get ready for work in the
morning.
I like to start my day with a lot of energy.
On my way to work, I check my schedule while listening to music.
Music is like a wondrous remedy for me.
When I'm tired, it relaxes me and when I'm down, it cheers me up.
3-2. When did you first become interested in music?
     Did anyone influence your music preference?
     Do you still listen to the same kind of music you did when you were a child?
     If not, how have your preferences changed?
When I was in high school, my best friend was into a Korean boy band and she let me borrow
her CD.
Before that, I was not very interested in any particular type of music.
However, when I listened to the first track of the CD, it was like a new world of music.
The singer wrapped really well and the song was really catchy.
I thought the melody was unique and I couldn't get it out of my head.
I totally fell in love with it.
We went to the concert and we just went crazy.
We screamed and danced really hard.
I guess that's when I really got into music.
I'm still a music lover, but as I've gotten older, my tastes have changed.
Now, I prefer soft and easy listening music like classical and jazz.
