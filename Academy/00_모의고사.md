[13.4 ~ 17.7]  Oh my, that was such a long time ago.
[17.7 ~ 23.7]  Honestly, I don't remember the very first time, but I can tell you about an old memory of
[23.7 ~ 25.3]  going to the theater.
[25.3 ~ 31.3]  I must have been about 11 years old, and I remember my dad was so excited about a new
[31.3 ~ 35.0]  movie coming out, but my mom refused to see it.
[35.0 ~ 38.6]  I think it was too violent for her or something.
[38.6 ~ 41.2]  One day my father picked me up from school.
[41.2 ~ 46.2]  He said I didn't have to go to my piano lesson that day because he had a special plan for
[46.2 ~ 47.2]  us.
[47.2 ~ 49.6]  First, he took me out for ice cream.
[49.6 ~ 51.6]  Then we went and watched the movie.
[51.6 ~ 53.5]  It was just a popcorn movie.
[53.5 ~ 57.7]  This story wasn't very good, but the action was so exciting.
[57.7 ~ 61.5]  Since then, action movies have been my favorite movie genre.
[61.5 ~ 65.5]  I still often go to the movies with my dad to watch action movies.
