Well... restaurant, compared to the past. I don't know..    
I haven't thought about the restaurant. So it's really hard to, you know, it's really tricky to answer.  
But if I had to tell you one thing, I'd say that I think it has become better than the past, like overall.  
And also the major reason if that technical development, technological development,  
such as smartphone, like internet, some like that.  
What I'm saying is, this is such an amazing world where there's nothing we can't do with smartphone, right?  
Yeah, and of course I can search for the restaurant with my smartphone, which is really, really convenient.  
And I'm pretty sure that it will be more convenient.
Well, but honestly, to be honest, I fell a little scared.  
Well, anyway, this is pretty much about it.  
This is all I can tell you at the moment.
