스트레스가 풀렸을 때의 장점과 단점
There are both advantages and disadvantages when stress is relieved.

The main advantage is that I feel much better and more relaxed.
When I am not stressed, I can focus better on my work and make better decisions.
Also, I sleep well and have more energy during the day.

However, sometimes when I feel too relaxed, I might become less motivated or lazy.
If stress disappears completely, I may lose a sense of urgency to finish tasks.
So, a little stress can be helpful to keep me focused and productive.
