1) Near my house/downtown/office/school  
음.. 우리집 근처에 00 이 있어 – which is  아주 커 – 그리고 나 같은 경우에는
가는 길에 단골 빵집이 있어 that is famous for salted빵 and I’m a regular
there – 그래서 거기 들러서 소금빵 하고 근처 I get some 커피 from self
service 커피숍에서 – 그리고 then 벤치가 있어 00 근처에 – so I I just sit
거기에, space out , have the 빵이랑 커피 that I bought and watch people
who pass by me– 그러면 그 자체로 it itself is a 나에게는 힐링이야 (그리고
나서 00에 가)  

You know, there is a movie theater near my house. Which is obviously
very close and also really huge. And in my case, on the way there is
my go to bakery, that is famous for salted bread and I'm a regular
there. So when I go to the movie theater, I stopped by the bakery 
to get salted bread and get some coffee from self service coffee shop
from nearby, which is a coffee with no staffs. And then there is  
a bench near the movie theater. So, I just sit down, space out, have the  
salted bread and coffee that I bought and watch people who pass by me.  
Then it itself is a healing for me. It's really nice and then I go to
the movie theater.

2) Far from my place  
사실 집 근처에도 00이 있어 – 근데 (아들이my son’s favorite) 좋아하는 00은  
멀리 있어 – which takes 한 (20분?)  by car– 그래서 when It’s time for  
lunch or dinner, we just try to eat something 그 근처에서 – 집 까지 가지  
않고 – and you know  it’s fun to consider// what we’re gonna eat (아들과)  
같이 고민하는 것도 즐거워 – anyway 집에서 좀 멀지만 but 좋은 곳이야 – I mean  
it’s worth the 시간  

Well, acually there is a park near my house, but my son's favorite
park is pretty far from my place Which takes about 20 minutes by car.
So, when it's time for lunch or dinner, we just try to do something nearby,
without going back home. And you know it's really fun to consider what we're
gonna eat together. Anyway, like I said, you know, my son't favorite park is
quite far, but it's a really good place. I mean, it's worth the time.

3) At home  
음.. 나는 가끔 집에서 00 을 해 – 왜냐면 그냥just 편하니까 – I don’t need to care
about others남 눈치 볼 필요 없고 – ,언제든지 끝낼 수 있고 it whenever I want  –
and on top of that, there are 사람도 있잖아 who are able to도와줄/같이 즐길  –
근데 사실 I don’t really like staying at home나는 집에 있는 걸 별로 좋아하지 않아
 – I mean[아민]  나 a homebody아니야 – 그렇지만 there are some times when I just
want to 가끔은 그냥 집에서 00 하고 싶을 때가 있어

Well you know sometimes just read books at home. which is Because, you know,
It's just comfortable. I don't know too care about others. I can finish it whenever
I want as well. And on top of that, there're some people who is able to enjoy with me.
But, as a matter of fact, I'm the type of person who really likes staying at home.
I mean, I'm not a homebody, but there're some times when I just want to read books at home.
