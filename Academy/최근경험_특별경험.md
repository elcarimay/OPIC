Well...concert?? last time?? ...um...two weeks ago, I planned to watch a rock 
ballard concert with my family. and actually I arrived at the park, first.
Because the concert was very famous and moreover there were tons of people.
So, I had to wait in line in advance.
What I'm saying is..the start of the concert was at 5 pm, but I got there
at 11 am. to wait. And the worst thing was that all of my skin got burned since
it was outdoor. So, as a result, after the concert, I bought a cream for sunburn
and applied it all over my arms and legs. And you know?
Now my skin started peeling off. Which makes me itchy all over my body.
Anyway the concert was fun and great and it was very unusual experience.

Well...memorable experience about the movie. Um...well let me see.
About [twelve years]ago, I was trying to watch a movie with my family. 
On the day of the screening, I was on my way to the theater when I suddenly
got a call that my father was sick.
So I immediately turned around and went to his house.
When I got there, I saw that his ankles were swollen and overlapping which
looked strange.
He told me that he had injured his leg after falling down the stairs while
going home drunk.
Well…apparently, he misstepped and hurt himself badly.
So The next day, he had to go to the hospital for treatment and wear a cast.
It was a serious situation, but thankfully, he recovered well.
Well.. anyway That experience reminded me of how dangerous drinking is,
and it really left a strong impression on me.
