1) By myself – 혼자서
나는 가끔(sometimes) 00을 혼자서 해 –  cuz  it’s 편하니까(comfortable) – 근데 사실 I’m not the type of person who likes to be
alone 뭔가를 혼자 하는 걸 그렇게 좋아하진 않아 – 그래서 in my case, 주로 가족들이랑 a lot of 활동을 하지 – you know even if
와이프나 아들이 혼자 있고 싶어 해도 내가 가서 말 걸고 그래go and talk to them– 내가 이야기 하는 걸 좋아하거든 (I like talking.
I think I’m a too much talker)  ㅋㅋㅋ – 하지만 가끔은 00 혼자하는 것도 좋아  

Well, you know.. I sometimes watch movies by myself. Cuz it's comfortable. By the way, as a matter of fact, I'm not the type
of the person who likes to be alone which means I don't like doing something or anything by myself. So, in my case, I usually
do a lot of activities with my family. You know even if my wife and son want to be alone, I just go and talk to them.
Because I like talking. I think I'm a too much talker. As I told you, sometimes I think it's good to watch movies by myself.

음.. 나는 00 아들이랑 해 – 왜냐면 he is the person who 내가 가장 시간 많이 보내는 사람이거든 with– well… 사실 내가 try to시간  
많이 보내려고– 그리고 it seems like 아들은 isn’t interested in 나 관심도 없어.. but also 별로 안 좋아 하는 것 같아 ㅜㅠㅠwhich  
is a little sad – 그래도 when 같이 00 하면 아들도 좋아하고 loves it and also I love 그 시간이 좋아 very much

you know.. I try to spend time with him. But it seems like he isn't interested in me, but also he didn't like me which is a

3) With my family
나는 보통 00 가족/베프들과 해 – 왜냐면 요즘 사람들이 다들 핸드폰이 있어서 핸드폰만 보잖아 although다같이 있는 시간에도
in the same place – 근데However,  when I 00 with 가족들/친구들이랑, 핸드폰 없이 서로 이야기를 나눌 수 있어서 which is really 좋아  
– and it’s literally 스마트폰 디톡스 – 그래서 나는(try to)  가족/베프들과 00 하려고 해 without smartphone

Well...I usually enjoy movie with my family. Because you know... nowadays everyone has
smartphone. So, they only focus on their smartphones although they are together
in the same place. However, when I go to the movie theater with my family,
we can talk each other without smartphone which is really really good.
And it's literally smartphone detox.
So, I try to watch movies with my family without smartphone.
