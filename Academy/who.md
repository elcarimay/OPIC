1) By myself – 혼자서
나는 가끔(sometimes) 00을 혼자서 해 –  cuz  it’s 편하니까(comfortable) – 근데 사실 I’m not the type of person who likes to be alone  뭔가를 혼자 하는 걸 그렇게 좋아하진 않아 – 그래서 in my case, 주로 가족들이랑 a lot of 활동을 하지 – you know even if 와이프나 아들이 혼자 있고 싶어 해도 내가 가서 말 걸고 그래go and talk to them– 내가 이야기 하는 걸 좋아하거든 (I like talking. I think I’m a too much talker)  ㅋㅋㅋ – 하지만 가끔은 00 혼자하는 것도 좋아

Well, you know.. I sometimes watch movies by myself. Cuz it's comfortable. By the way, as a matter of fact, I'm not the type of the person who likes to be alone which means I don't like doing something or anything by myself. So, in my case, I usually do a lot of activities with my family. You know even if my wife and son want to be alone, I just go and talk to them. Because I like talking. I think I'm a too much talker. As I told you, sometimes I think it's good to watch movies by myself.
