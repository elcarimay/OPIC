### 1) 최근경험
```
음… 한 2주 전인가?? 가족들과 00 계획이 있었어 – 근데 내가 먼저 [장소]에 갔어
왜냐면 00이 인기가 너무 많고 사람들이 진짜 많아서 미리 가서 줄을 서야 했거든
그 00이 시작/ 오픈이 5시인데 나는 11시부터 줄 서 있었어 – 그리고 야외여서  피부가 다 탔어
그래서 나중에 화상크림 사서 팔 다리에 발랐어 … ㅋㅋㅋ – 지금은 피부가 벗겨지기 시작했어
너무 간지러워….… - 어쨌든 00도 재밌었고/좋았고 너무 색다른 경험이었어…

Well last time um... festival? Oh, maybe it probably like two weeks ago,
I planned to go to a festival with my family. And I was one that arrived at
the festival first because you know, I mean there was a big event and it was
very popular and moreover there were tons of people so I had to wait in line in advance.
What I'm saying is, you know, It started at 5 p.m., but I got there at 11 a.m.
to wait. And the worst thing was that all of my skin got burned since it was
outdoor. So, as a result, after enjoying the festival. I bought a cream for sunburn
later and applied it all over my arms and legs. And you know what, you know,
after that my skin started peeling off, which made me itchy all over my body.
Anyway it was very fun and great and it was very unusual experience.

Well...memorable experience about the movie. Um...well let me see.
About [twelve years]ago, I was trying to watch a movie with my family. 
On the day of the screening, I was on my way to the theater when I suddenly
got a call that my father was sick.
So I immediately turned around and went to his house.
When I got there, I saw that his ankles were swollen and overlapping which
looked strange.
He told me that he had injured his leg after falling down the stairs while
going home drunk.
Well…apparently, he misstepped and hurt himself badly.
So The next day, he had to go to the hospital for treatment and wear a cast.
It was a serious situation, but thankfully, he recovered well.
Well.. anyway That experience reminded me of how dangerous drinking is,
and it really left a strong impression on me.
