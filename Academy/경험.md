```
But there’s one thing I do every day.
It’s taking care of my small pets.
I have 16 of them, and I’ve been raising them for about 3 or 4 years.
Actually, my wife doesn’t really like them.
She doesn’t even come into the room where they are, so I have to take care of everything.

What I mean is, I wake up early in the morning, check on them, and do some simple cleaning.
Of course, I also take care of them at night before going to bed.
So from the moment I open my eyes until I close them, I’m always looking after my pets.

Before I do 00, there’s nothing special except taking care of my lizards.
After that, I do 00—that’s it.
