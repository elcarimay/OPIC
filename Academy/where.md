1) Near my house/downtown/office/school  
음.. 우리집 근처에 00 이 있어 – which is  아주 커 – 그리고 나 같은 경우에는
가는 길에 단골 빵집이 있어 that is famous for salted빵 and I’m a regular
there – 그래서 거기 들러서 소금빵 하고 근처 I get some 커피 from self
service 커피숍에서 – 그리고 then 벤치가 있어 00 근처에 – so I I just sit
거기에, space out , have the 빵이랑 커피 that I bought and watch people
who pass by me– 그러면 그 자체로 it itself is a 나에게는 힐링이야 (그리고
나서 00에 가)  

Well...There is a movie theater near my house. Which is a huge. And in  
my case, on the way, there is a bakery, that is famous for salted bread  
and I'm a regular there. So when I visit there, I buy some salted bread  
and I get some coffee from self service coffee shop, and then there is  
a bench near the movie theater. So, I just sit down, space out, have the  
salted bread and coffee that I bought and watch people who pass by me.  
Then it itself is a healing to me. And then I go to the movie theater.

2) Far from my place  
사실 집 근처에도 00이 있어 – 근데 (아들이my son’s favorite) 좋아하는 00은  
멀리 있어 – which takes 한 (20분?)  by car– 그래서 when It’s time for  
lunch or dinner, we just try to eat something 그 근처에서 – 집 까지 가지  
않고 – and you know  it’s fun to consider// what we’re gonna eat (아들과)  
같이 고민하는 것도 즐거워 – anyway 집에서 좀 멀지만 but 좋은 곳이야 – I mean  
it’s worth the 시간  

Acually...there is a park near my house, but my son's favorite park is
far from my house Which takes about 20 minutes by car. So, when it's
time for lunch or dinner, we just try to eat something nearby without
going home. And you know...it's fun to consider what we're gonna eat
with my son. Anyway, it's a little far from my house but it's a good
place I mean it's worth the time.

3) At home  
음.. 나는 가끔 집에서 00 을 해 – 왜냐면 그냥just 편하니까 – I don’t need to care
about others남 눈치 볼 필요 없고 – ,언제든지 끝낼 수 있고 it whenever I want  –
and on top of that, there are 사람도 있잖아 who are able to도와줄/같이 즐길  –
근데 사실 I don’t really like staying at home나는 집에 있는 걸 별로 좋아하지 않아
 – I mean[아민]  나 a homebody아니야 – 그렇지만 there are some times when I just
want to 가끔은 그냥 집에서 00 하고 싶을 때가 있어

Well... um...I sometimes read books at home. Because which is comfortable.
I don't care about others. I can finish whenever I want. And on top of that,
there're some people who is able to enjoy with me.
But, to be honest, I don't really like staying at home. I mean I'm not a homebody.
But, there're some times when I just want to read books at home.
