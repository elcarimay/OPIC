1) Relieve my stress
나는 보통 00을 해 스트레스 받을때 - 왜냐면 I can 스트레스 풀리거든- 근데  
사실 I'm not the type of person who gets 스트레스를 받다-왜냐면 좀
낙천적이거든 optimistic / positive - I mean 노력해 생각하려고 긍정적으로
all the time - 하지만 사람이니까 human being. 가끔 스트레스 받지-그럴때는
in that case, 00를 해.

Well...in my case I usually do exersize when I get stressed out, because 
there is a thing that helps me with my stress. But, in fact, I'm not the
type of person who easily gets stressed, because I'm quite optimistic and
positive. I mean I try to think positively all the time, but as a human being, 
it's definitely possible that I get stressed out. So that, you know, I mean,
in the case, I just do exersize which is really good.

2) Cheer up
가끔 기분 다운 될 때가 있어 – when그런 기분이 들 때 00을 해 – 그러면
치얼업 돼 – and 또한 it’s a  긍정적인 영향이 있어 나에게 – 무슨
말이냐면 it motivates me일을 더 열심히 하고 최선을 다할 수 있는 동기가
돼 – which is why 내 생각에는 00이 좋은 방법 인것 같아 – 기분 나아질
수 있는  

Well... you know, actually there are some times when I feel a little down.
and when I feel that way, I just go swimming. Then it makes me sure all.
And on top of that, it has a positive effect on me. What I'm trying to say
is, it motivates me to work harder and do my best. Which is why I think
swimming is a good way of feeling better.   
```
```
3) Kill time
킬타임할 때 주로 00을 해 – 왜냐면 사실 내가 don’t really like 시간을
낭비하는 걸 별로 안 좋아하거든? – 근데 00을 할 때는? It’s not only fun
하지만 it helps me to (스트레스에/건강을 유지) 그리고 물론 시간이 goes
정말 빨리 – which is 좋아 – 다시 말해서 it’s easy to spend시간을 내가
00 할 때  

Well, as you may know, there are some times when I kill time.
In the case, I usually play basketball with my son. Because actually I
don't really like wasting time. But when I play basketball with my son,
it's not only fun but also it helps me to relieve my stress and it's alse
maintain my health. And it's obviously that time goes really fast. I mean
I don't even notice how time passes by when playing basketball with my son
which is really good. In other words it's definitely one of the easiest ways
to spend time. I'm in kill time.
