1) Free time - 쉴때(ex.주말, 00요일에)  
나는 00 하는 편이야 쉴 때 – which is mainly on the주말이야 – 왜냐면 당연히 주중에는 일하니까 on weekdays
– What I’m saying is… by the time 집 오면 퇴근하고, it’s 한 8시 되거든? then 배고프니까  so과일[프룻ㅊ] 먹고
~ 설거지 하고 뭐 그런 거 … 해 – which basically means그러면 뭐 할 시간이 없어 to do anything- 그래서 I can’t
help but 주말에 00 할 수 밖에 없지  

Well...I tend to read books when I have free time which is mainly on the weekends.  
Because, of course I have to work on weekdays.  
What I'm saying is ... you know by the time I come home after work, it's about eight pm.  
Then I'm really hungry, so I eat some fruits and do the dishes and so on.  
Which basically means I have no time to do anything, so I can't help but read books on the weekends.
