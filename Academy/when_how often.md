1) Free time - 쉴때(ex.주말, 00요일에)  
나는 00 하는 편이야 쉴 때 – which is mainly on the주말이야 – 왜냐면 당연히 주중에는 일하니까 on weekdays
– What I’m saying is… by the time 집 오면 퇴근하고, it’s 한 8시 되거든? then 배고프니까  so과일[프룻ㅊ] 먹고
~ 설거지 하고 뭐 그런 거 … 해 – which basically means그러면 뭐 할 시간이 없어 to do anything- 그래서 I can’t
help but 주말에 00 할 수 밖에 없지  

Well...I tend to read books when I have free time which is mainly on the weekends.  
Because, of course I have to work on weekdays.  
What I'm saying is ... by the time I come home after work, it's about eight pm.  
which is the time for me to eat something cuz I get hungry so I eat some fruits and do the dishes after that.  
yeah... I do stuff like that Which basically means I have no time to do anything, so for that reason, I can't
help but read books on the weekends.
*go swimming / jogging / shopping / running
*enjoy driving

2) No set time - 정해진 시간x
음 사실 딱히 정해진 시간은 없어 00 을 위해서는 – 무슨 말이냐면 I don’t do that 정기적으로 하지 않아 –
 왜냐면 너무 어렵거든 to make the 시간 – 나도 일하고 와이프도 일하고 and 우리 아들 is busy going to
 학교랑 학원es – which means, our스케줄이are 다 달라 –같이 It’s hard to 00 하기가 사실은 어려워
 – that’s why we그래서 할 수 있을 때 해
 
Well...as a matter of fact, there is no set time for shopping, what I'm trying to saying is that...
I don't do that on the regular basis, because it's really tough to make the time.
I mean I work, so does my wife, and my son is also busy going to school and academies.
Which means our schedule are all different. So to tell you the truth, It's quite hard to go shopping together.
That's why we go shopping when we can.

*by the time: ~할 때 쯤
