Many young people in Korea desire to work for well-established companies, often referred to as "big companies".

given the competitive job market in Korea. In addition, these companies often offer high salaries and generous
benefits packages, which can be very attractive to young job seekers.
*Another reason why these companies are popular is that they are seen as offering opportunities for career advancement and professional development. Many young Koreans view working for a large company as a way to gain valuable experience and build their resume, which can help them in their future careers.

Finally, some young people in Korea are drawn to these companies because of their strong brand recognition and reputation. Companies like Samsung and Hyundai are not only household names in Korea but are also recognized globally, which can be appealing to young job seekers who want to work for a respected and successful company.

Overall, while there are certainly other companies and industries that young Koreans are interested in, the allure of working for a well-known and established company is a common career goal for many.
