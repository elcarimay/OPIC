## Q1) Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like? Tell me everything about the weather.

Weather and seasons in Korea? Well.. Korea has 4 seasons, spring, summer, fall and winter. It's all distinct.. I mean each season  
has different things to offer. Fist, let me tell you about spring and fall first because sping and fall are quite similar in  
many ways. The temperatures are very mild. It's between 17~20 celsius so it's not too hot or cold and there's a nice breeze.
So many people go on a picnic during sping and fall. In spring, lots of flowers bloom. Officially spring starts in March but  
it's still freezing due to the last cold snap. In fall, leaves turn red and yellow at the end of the season, all of them fall  
down and it looks very amazing. In terms of summer, it usually starts with monsoon season. During this time, it rains almost  
everyday for about a month but once it's over, real summer starts and it usually last about 2 months. So most people go on a  
vacation during summer. For the last, winter in Korea is very long, cold and dry. Yeah it snows a lot and things get frozen.  
In average, temperature goes zero and days are short so around 6 pm, it gets very dark. I think it's all about 4 seasons of Korea.

## Q2) How has the weather in your country changed over the years? Is the weather different from what it used to do? How has it changed? Give me all the details.
```
Changes in weather? well.. as I mentioned .. we still have 4 distinct seasons in Korea. But the problem is.. It's getting hotter  
and more humid especially in summer. You know? Global warming? .. simply.. it increased the temperature of the earth and it's a  
serious problem all over the world. But Korea has been influenced a lot from that. That's why spring and fall are becoming  
shorter even in spring and fall. It's temperature is usually higher than usual.  
Also, find dust pollution is another big changes. It's a recent change in weather. I think it's too bad .. In the past, people  
used to check only temperature.. nowadays.. they also check air quality because fine dust is a serious problem in Korea. So  
many people wear fine dust mask to protect themselves from the pollution. I think there are biggest changes in terms of weather.

## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident related to the severe weather. What was the problem and how did you deal with the situation? What made that incident unforgettable?
```
One day in summer, it was said to rain a few days ago, but there was a forecast that it would not rain that morning, so I went camping.
I thought it was a shower  because it rained on the way to the camping site three hours away from home, but it came until I arrived.
I arrived at the camping site, but it rained so much that I had to go home again. I prepared a lot, but it was a pity. In the car coming home,
I thought I should cancel our camping plan if I hear that the weather is bad next time.  
```
## Q4) How was the weather today at where you are? Was it cold, was it warm? Talk about today's weather in detail.
```
Today's weather? Hmm. It's summer time here so it's very hot. I think it's about 30 degree Celsius outside. Yeah, I think it's not
too bad. I'm quite used to this kind of weather. Anyway most people wear light clothes when they go out and I also did. It's going
to be hot like this for the next 2 or 3 month. The morning lows are around 25 degree celsius. The afternoon lows are about 30 degree
celsius. During this time of the year, it usually gets sunny and rainy. And the sun sets so slow around 8 pm. According to the weather
forecast, next week will be better than this week. Yeah, that's all about today's weather.
