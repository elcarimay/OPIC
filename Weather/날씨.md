## Q1) Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like? Tell me everything about the weather.
```
In Korea, we experience four distinct seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter — and each one has its own unique charm.

Spring and fall are quite similar in terms of weather. The temperatures are usually mild, around 17 to 20 degrees Celsius, and there’s often a gentle breeze, which makes it a great time to enjoy the outdoors.
In spring, you can see cherry blossoms and other flowers blooming everywhere. It officially starts in March, though it can still feel a bit chilly in the beginning.

Fall is known for its beautiful autumn foliage. By the end of the season, the leaves turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow, creating amazing scenery.
Many people enjoy going on picnics or hiking trips during these two seasons.

Summer in Korea usually starts with the monsoon season, when it rains almost every day for about a month.
After that, the real summer begins, and it gets hot and humid for about two months. This is also the time when most people go on vacation.

Winter is quite long, cold, and dry, with freezing temperatures and occasional heavy snowfall.
On average, the temperature is around 0 degrees Celsius, and the days are shorter, with the sun setting around 6 PM.

Personally, I enjoy each season for its unique atmosphere and beauty.
They all offer something special, and I think that’s one of the great things about living in Korea.

## Q2) How has the weather in your country changed over the years? Is the weather different from what it used to do? How has it changed? Give me all the details.
```
In recent years, the weather in Korea has shown noticeable changes, even though we still experience the four distinct seasons.
These changes are mainly due to global warming and environmental issues, which have affected the overall climate.

One major change is the increasing temperatures.
Summers have become hotter and more humid than before, and as a result, the spring and fall seasons have become shorter.
The temperatures during those transitional seasons tend to be warmer than usual.

Another big concern is the rise in fine dust pollution, which has become a serious problem in Korea recently.
People now pay close attention not only to the weather forecast but also to the air quality index before planning outdoor activities.
It’s common to see many people wearing fine dust masks to protect themselves, especially on days when pollution levels are high.

These changes in weather and air quality have had a significant impact on the daily lives of many Koreans, making us more cautious about when and how we spend time outdoors.

## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident related to the severe weather. What was the problem and how did you deal with the situation? What made that incident unforgettable?
```
One summer day, I heard there might be a chance of rain, but the morning weather forecast predicted clear skies, so I decided to go camping.
Unfortunately, as soon as I left home, it started raining. I assumed it was just a passing shower and didn’t worry too much.

The campsite was about a three-hour drive away, so I hoped the rain would stop before I got there.
However, when I finally arrived, the rain had intensified significantly.
At that point, I had to make the difficult decision to cancel the trip and head back home.

I had prepared a lot for this camping trip, so it was really disheartening to have it cut short by unexpected weather.

What made this experience unforgettable was the contrast between my excitement and preparation, and the sudden disappointment caused by the rain.
It taught me a valuable lesson to always check the weather forecast carefully and be ready for sudden changes, especially when planning outdoor activities.

## Q4) How was the weather today at where you are? Was it cold, was it warm? Talk about today's weather in detail.
```
Today in Dongtan, the weather was absolutely delightful. It was sunny and warm, with temperatures reaching around 22 degrees Celsius.
The sky stayed clear all day, and the sunshine was bright and abundant.

Many people took advantage of this beautiful weather by enjoying various outdoor activities — like relaxing in parks, sitting at cafes, or strolling along the riverbanks.
The gentle breeze made the air feel very comfortable and refreshing, which made it an ideal day for a picnic, a walk, or just spending time outside.

The sunny weather lasted well into the evening, and the day ended with a breathtaking sunset, painting the sky with gorgeous colors.

According to the weather forecast, the upcoming week is expected to be even better, so I’m really looking forward to more days like today.
Overall, it was a fantastic day in Dongtan — perfect for enjoying the outdoors and soaking up the sunshine.
