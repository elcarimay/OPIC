## Q1) Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like? Tell me everything about the weather.
```
In Korea, we experience four distinct seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. Each season
has its unique characteristics.

Spring and fall are quite similar. The temperatures are very mild, usually between 17 to 20
degrees Celsius, making it pleasant with a gentle breeze. Many people go on picnics during
these seasons. Spring is known for its blossoming flowers, officially starting in March, although
it can still be a bit chilly due to the remnants of winter. In fall, the leaves turn vibrant shades
of red and yellow toward the end of the season, creating a stunning landscape.

Summer in Korea typically begins with the monsoon season, during which it rains almost daily
for about a month. Once the monsoon season ends, the real summer begins and lasts for about
two months. This is when most people take vacations.

Winter in Korea is long, cold, and dry, with heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. On
average, the temperature hovers around freezing, and the days are short, with darkness setting
in around 6 pm.

Personally, I enjoy each season for its unique charm.

## Q2) How has the weather in your country changed over the years? Is the weather different from what it used to do? How has it changed? Give me all the details.
```
In recent years, the weather in Korea has undergone noticeable changes. While we still
experience four distinct seasons, the overall climate has shifted due to global warming.
Specifically, there are a few significant changes:

Increasing Temperatures: Summers have become hotter and more humid due to rising global
temperatures. This leads to shorter spring and fall seasons, as the temperatures during these
times are higher than usual.

Fine Dust Pollution: Another significant change is the increase in fine dust pollution. This is a
recent development, and it has become a major concern in Korea. People now regularly check
air quality in addition to temperature when planning outdoor activities. Many individuals wear
fine dust masks to protect themselves from the pollution.

These changes in weather patterns are concerning and have had a noticeable impact on daily
life in Korea.

## Q3) Tell me about a memorable incident related to the severe weather. What was the problem and how did you deal with the situation? What made that incident unforgettable?
```
One summer day, I heard that there was a chance of rain, but the morning forecast predicted
otherwise, so I decided to go camping. Unfortunately, it started raining as soon as I left home,
but I assumed it was just a passing shower. The camping site was a three-hour drive away, and
I hoped the rain would stop on the way.

However, when I arrived at the camping site, the rain intensified, forcing me to make the
difficult decision to abandon the trip and return home. I had prepared extensively for the
camping excursion, and it was disheartening to have to cancel it.

What made this incident unforgettable was the anticipation and preparation leading up to the
trip, only to have it cut short due to the unexpected weather change. It served as a valuable
lesson to check weather forecasts more diligently and be prepared for sudden weather shifts
when planning outdoor activities.

## Q4) How was the weather today at where you are? Was it cold, was it warm? Talk about today's weather in detail.
```
Today in Dongtan, the weather was delightful. It was sunny and warm, with temperatures
reaching approximately 22 degrees Celsius. The sky remained clear throughout the day, with
abundant sunshine. People took advantage of the pleasant weather by enjoying outdoor
activities in parks, cafes, and along the riverbanks.

The gentle breeze made the air feel comfortable and refreshing. It was an ideal day for various
outdoor pursuits, such as visiting the park, having a picnic, or going for a leisurely walk.
The sunny conditions persisted until evening, providing a picturesque sunset with beautiful
colors in the sky.

According to the weather forecast, the upcoming week is expected to be even better than this
one. Overall, it was a fantastic day in Dongtan, perfect for spending time outdoors.
