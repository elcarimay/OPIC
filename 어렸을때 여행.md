# Do you remember a trip when you were a child? What did you do? What was the special thing in your trip?
```
I might have gone on a family trip to a beach. During the trip, I had played in the sand, swam in the ocean
with tube, built sandcastles, collected seashells, and gone on walks along the shore. The special thing about
the trip had been the opportunity to have a good time with family members, enjoy the beautiful scenery.
