# Have you ever canceled plans because of something unexpected?

In general, Campers are sensitive to the weather, so they wake up, turn on the weather app in their cellphone, and
check the today's weather.
About one year ago,I was going to go camping early in the morning, but I couldn't go because of the bad weather.
Finally I ate breakfast at home in the morining with my family.

# Have you ever bought tickets, but couldn't make it because something unexpected happened?
```
About twelve years ago, I bought a movie tickets. At the day of screening, I was going to
the movie theater. But I couldn't go. I received a call that my father got hurt while
going down the stairs. So I went to my father and looked at how sick he was.
My father wore a cast because his ankles overlapped.
