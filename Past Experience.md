# Have you ever canceled plans because of something unexpected?
```
In general, Campers are sensitive to the weather, so they wake up, turn on the weather app in their cellphone, and
check the today's weather.
About one year ago,I was going to go camping early in the morning, but I couldn't go because of the bad weather.
Finally I ate breakfast at home in the morining with my family.

# Have you ever bought tickets, but couldn't make it because something unexpected happened?
```
About twelve years ago, I bought a movie tickets. At the day of screening, I was going to
the movie theater. But I couldn't go. I received a call that my father got hurt while
going down the stairs. So I went to my father and looked at how sick he was.
My father wore a cast because his ankles overlapped.

# What did you do at your last gathering or celebration? What was the occasion?
```
On the morning of the Last Children's day, my family went to the flower garden in Paju in the northern part of Korea.
There were various kinds of flowers and the garden was well decorated, so I was busy taking pictures
with my family. The weather was bad because it rained, but it was good to see flowers because it was indoors.
And after, we went to the National Museum of korea. There were historical puzzles and souvenirs for children.
It was a happy day to my family.

# Which performance or show did you last watch? When did you watch it and which theater did you go to? What did you do befor and after going to the theater?
```
I watched a movie called Galaxy of Guardians three in the theater on May 4th.
The movie theater is located in Dongtan, hwaseoung city.
Before going to the theater, I had checked the showtimes and bought tickets online.
I had also planned to arrive early to get a good seat and buy some snacks or drinks.
After watching the movie, I had discussed the plot and characters with my son.
I had shared my opinions and favorite scenes from the movie. And I came back at home with my family.

# Please tell me about one of your experiences when you went to the park recently. Give me a full story of what you did from the moment you arrived at the park until you left.
```
I went to the park with my son by bicycle last Sunday. There were soccer fields, basketball courts, etc. in the park.
I played soccer with my son because he likes soccer. My son likes to break through, but I like to pass,
so I decided to do it half and half and did it for about an hour.
After one hour, we sweated,and we went to the convenience store and bought ice cream and drinks,
and came home riding a bicycle
```
# Please tell me about the most recent concert you went to. What did you do before and after the concert?
```
I was able to go to the concert because the company distributed tickets for
classical and Korean traditional music performances for free.
I and my son went to the concert hall in Cheonan City Hall.
We ate some food in the car and entered in time for the performances.
My son was a little bored because it was a classical performance, but I thought it would have been a good experience.
The performance was very good and I felt like listening to it again.
I was so happy that my son said it was a good performance in the car on the way back.
