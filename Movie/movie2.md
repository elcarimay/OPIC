## Q1. You indicate in your survey you like to watch a movie. How often do you go to the movies? Where do you usually go? Who do you go with?
```
I enjoy watching movies. I usually like to watch action films like Iron Man and Transformers.
These big-scale action movies help me relieve stress and feel refreshed.

Sometimes, I watch historical movies with my family.
They’re not only educational but also just as interesting as action movies.

Since I work on weekdays, I can usually only watch movies on weekends.
I used to go to the theater at least once every two months.

I usually go to CGV, a popular multiplex theater in Korea, because it’s close to my home.
I make reservations using a mobile app, which makes booking or canceling tickets very easy.

When I go to the movies, I usually buy popcorn — but only when I don’t go with my wife.
She’s sensitive to smells and doesn’t really like the smell of popcorn.

Most of the time, I watch movies with my family.
It’s become a routine for us to enjoy a movie together on the weekend.

## 2. What do you usually do before you go to a movie theater? What do you do after watching the movie? Please tell me about a typical day when you go to the movies.
```
The first thing I usually do before going to the movie theater is double-check my reservation.
I normally reserve tickets online in advance, and I always record my personal schedule on my phone.
After booking the ticket, I reconfirm the schedule to make sure there are no mistakes.
Actually, once I forgot to double-check and didn’t realize I had booked the wrong time, which caused some problems.

Next, I check the location of the theater. Since I usually drive, I need to see if there’s enough parking space available.
I also check how much the parking fee is and whether parking can be validated.

Whenever possible, I try to watch movies in the morning to get a morning discount.
After the movie, I usually look for a restaurant nearby and have lunch with my family.
During lunch, we like to talk about the movie — what we liked, what surprised us, and how we felt about it.

So, that’s what a typical movie day looks like for me.

## 3. Can you tell me about your favorite actor or actress? What does he or she look like? How is his or her acting?
```
I really like Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man in the Marvel movies.
I’ve always liked his witty jokes and unique, free-spirited personality.
I heard that he had some issues with drugs when he was younger, but I think those life experiences add depth to his acting.
I admire him as an actor, not necessarily on a personal level.

In the movies, he’s portrayed as a strong and confident hero who defeats villains.
One of the most popular aspects of Iron Man is his high-tech suit, which is often edited and shared in YouTube videos.
It’s really impressive to see an ordinary person transform into a superhero by wearing a suit filled with intelligent electronic systems.
He can shoot electricity from his hands, fire missiles, and fly freely through the sky.

I think people love the idea that anyone can become a hero by wearing that suit — it gives a sense of hope and excitement.
And of course, the battle scenes are amazing.
In particular, I love the fight between Iron Man and the Hulk.
The Hulk is known as the strongest being on Earth, but Iron Man holds his own by wearing the Hulkbuster suit — that scene was unforgettable.

I heard that Robert Downey Jr. left the Marvel series due to a disagreement over his appearance fee,
but I’m still looking forward to seeing him in future films.
