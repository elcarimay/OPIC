Q1. You indicate in your survey you like to watch a movie. How often do you go to the movies? Where do you usually go?
Who do you go with?

I enjoy watching movie. I usually like to watch action movies such as Iron Man and Transformer. 
These big-scaled action movies make me relieve my stress. 
I sometimes watch historical movies when I am with my family. 
They are not only beneficial but also very interesting as action movies. 
Since I am working on weekdays, I can only watch a movie on weekends. 
I used to go to a movie theater at least once every two months.
I usually go to CGV which is a multiplex movie theater in Korea, because it is located closed to my home. 
I usually make reservations with a mobile phone application, but reservations and cancellations are too easy.
When I arrive at the movie theater and watch a movie, I buy popcorn if I don't go with a wife. 
Because my wife is sensitive to smell, but she doesn't like the smell of popcorn that much.
I usually watch movies with my family. It is routine for us to watch movie together. 
 

2. What do you usually do before you go to a movie theater? What do you do after watching the movie? Please tell me about
 a typical day when you go to the movies.
 
 First thing I usually do before going to a movie theater is double-checking my reservation. 
 I usually reserve the ticket online in advance. I usually record my personal schedule on my phone, so I reconfirm my 
 phone's schedule after making a movie reservation. Once I did not double-check my reservation and did not realized I
 booked a wrong ticket. Next thing I do is to look for the location of the movie theater. I usually use my car to go
 anywhere so I need to see if there are enough parking spaces available. 
 I also make sure how much the parking fee is and whether parking can be verified. I try to watch movies in the morning
to get a morning discount. After watching the movie, search for a restaurant for lunch. During lunch, we talk about
what we felt after watching the movie. That's all about my typical day watching movie.
 
 
3. Can you tell me about your favorite actor or actress? What does he or she look like? How is his or her acting?

I like Robert Downey Jr. who played Iron Man in Marvel movies. I always like witty jokes and unique freewheeling
 personality. It is said that he took drugs when he was young, but the experience of life seems to come from acting.
 I like it as an actor, not personally. In any case, in the movie, he is portrayed as a strong hero who defeats villains.
 First of all, Iron Man's suit is so popular that it is edited and posted on YouTube. It is really impressive to see
 ordinary people suddenly become heroes in suits containing intelligent electronic equipment. Electricity goes out of
the hand and missiles are fired from the suit as they fly freely. People seem to like the hope that ordinary people may
become heroes in that suit. And the battle scene is great, too. In particular, the battle scene with the Hulk is the best.
Hulk has the strongest body on Earth, and Iron Man fights equally in a Hulkbuster suit. 
I heard that he dropped out of the Marvel movie due to the appearance fee problem, but I'm looking forward to see him
 in the next movie.
