## Q1) What is your favorite movie genre? Why do you like those movie?
```
Choosing a favorite movie genre is quite challenging for me because I really appreciate the diversity in films.
However, if I had to pick, I’d say I love animation and sci-fi movies the most.

When it comes to animation, I especially enjoy Disney films like Toy Story.
I love the cute and expressive characters, and I also appreciate the valuable life lessons they often include.
They’re fun to watch, but also meaningful.

As for sci-fi, I’m a huge fan of the Avengers series.
The presence of so many iconic heroes, especially Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, really captivates me.
His acting is outstanding, and the storylines are always exciting and well-developed.

Every time I watch these movies, I feel completely drawn into the world of superheroes.
They’re entertaining, emotional, and full of action — everything I look for in a movie.

## Q2) Tell me about the movie theater you went recently. What did you do before and after the movie?
```
Recently, my company organized a free movie event at a nearby theater.
I decided to watch Oppenheimer, a film about scientists developing the atomic bomb, after being inspired by an interview with the director.

Before watching a movie, I usually check the schedule in advance and buy tickets online.
I also like to buy popcorn and drinks for my son before we go in.

After the movie, my family and I usually spend some time at the shopping mall where the theater is located.
We enjoy browsing the shops, and if we’re hungry, we’ll have a meal at a restaurant.
We also love talking about the movie — sharing our thoughts and favorite scenes together.
``` 
## Q3) What was the most memorable movie you watched in the past? what was it about? What was so special about the movie? Would you recommend to other people?
```
One of the most memorable movies for me is Golden Slumber, which is based on a Japanese novel.
The story follows a deliveryman who is framed for the assassination of a politician, and it explores powerful themes like trust and betrayal.

Although the film doesn’t rely on flashy special effects, the gripping storyline and the outstanding performance by Kang Dong-won, one of Korea’s top actors, made a strong impression on me.

It really made me reflect on what true relationships and loyalty mean, and that’s why I still think about it even now.
I highly recommend this movie to others — not just for the suspense, but also for its emotional depth.  
```
## Q4) Tell me about one of the actors who was in the news because of some issue recently. What was the issue about? How did the news effect your impression of that actor?
```
Recently, I heard some news about Robert Downey Jr., my favorite Hollywood actor, leaving the Avengers series due to a disagreement over his salary.
While I understand his perspective, as someone who admires his dedication to his roles, I couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed.

At the same time, I learned more about other actors like Jim Carrey, who often prioritize meaningful roles over money, and that really increased my respect for them.

It made me reflect on how different actors choose their careers — some focus on their craft, while others may be more business-minded.
Either way, I still admire Robert Downey Jr. for the incredible performances he gave, especially as Iron Man.
```
## Q5) Could you compare the movies made today to movies you saw while you were growing up?
```
When I was a child, Hollywood movies were much more popular than Korean films because of their higher production quality and more engaging storylines.
However, things have changed a lot in recent years. Korean cinema has improved drastically in both quality and storytelling, and it has gained international recognition.

In fact, some Korean movies have even broken box office records and attracted attention from audiences both at home and abroad.
This shift clearly reflects the evolution of the Korean film industry over the years.

It’s exciting to see how far Korean cinema has come, and I feel proud whenever a Korean film receives global praise.
```
## Q6) When you talk about movies with your friends or family members, what topics do you discuss? Why are these issues of interest or concern to you and your friends? What makes them so important? Plus, what are some important trends in the movie industry?
```
When my friends and I talk about movies, we often discuss the latest trends in 3D and 4D technology in cinemas.
These formats offer a more immersive experience, which really enhances our enjoyment of the film.

We also talk about premium theaters, IMAX screens, and even the ability to watch 3D movies at home — all of which feel like major advancements in movie-watching.

These kinds of discussions show how much the technology behind films is still evolving.
As movie lovers, we find it really exciting to see how new innovations continue to improve the overall viewing experience.
