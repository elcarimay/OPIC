## Q1) What is your favorite movie genre? Why do you like those movie?
```
Yeah, my favorite movie genre? well .. it's a hard question ..
I love all kinds .. because it's all different .. you know ..
I think I like to watch all different kinds but if I have to choose, I would say I love to watch animation and sci-fi.  
First, in terms of animation movies.. I'm a huge fan of Disney movie. Because there are usually bunch of cute animal  
characters with people. And I learn certain types of lesson after that. So, my favorite animation is a Toy Story, so  
when I saw it for the first time, I was touched and I cried .. yeah, I was a very young kid so I was very impressed  
by this movie. Disney movies are usually creative and have an interesting storyline.  
Another movie genre I like is .. sci-fi, yeah .. there are so many different kinds but one of my favorite would be avengers  
story. There are so many heroes i this film, but Robert Downey Jr is absoultely my favorite, He's a great actor so  
his acting plays a big role in this movie. Also, it's solid story-line and cast make this movie even better. Anyway,  
whenever this movie is released, I have to go to the movie theatre to see it. I love Robert Downey Jr. Yeah, I heard  
Avengers series is way more popular here in Korea than any other Asian countries.  
Overall, these are all about my favorite movie genre.  
```
## Q2) Tell me about the movie theater you went recently. What did you do before and after the movie?
```
I remember going to the movie theater nearby my place. Yeah, actually movie theater is only 10 minutes by walk, so I  
like to go there especially on Friday night.  
Recently, I watched Korean movie called "The Drug King". It was about one guy who got involved in drug business.  
One of my favortie Korean actor is cast in this film, so I had to see it and it wasn't too bad.  
Anyway, what do I do before movie? Well.. I usually check movie schedule and get tickets.. And my boyfriend always  
comes with me .. also, we usually buy some drinks before movie starts.. nowadays, beer is available at the theater.  
So we never forget to grab some beer!!!  
After the movie, I like to walk around the shopping mall and browse things. The theater near my home is located inside  
the shopping mall, so that's what I do. If I get hungry, I go to the restaurant to have lunch or dinner. And I talk  
about the movie with my boyfriend. I think that's all about it!!! 
``` 
## Q3) What was the most memorable movie you watched in the past? what was it about? What was so special about the movie? Would you recommend to other people?
```
→ 가장 기억에 남는 영화, 줄거리  
There are so many movies I watched .. and they were all different .. So it's pretty much all memorable to me .. but  
I would say. Golden Slumber was the most memorable movie I watched in the past. Actually, this movie is based on Japanese novel.  
In this film, one deliveryman flees for his life after he's framed for a politican's assassination. His best friend  
betrayed him and framed him for crime. It didn't have any special effect like SF movies but pretty intense.  
Furthermore, I love 강동원 who is well-known korean actor so it was pretty good movie to me.(영화에 관한 설명)  
While I was watching this movie, I thought about trust and need to figure out who is trustworthy.(영화보고 느낀 점)  
→ 영화에 대한 소개  
Honestly.. the reason this movie was so special to me .. was I went to this movie preview .. so I could see 강동원 and other movie stars.  
There were so many people like news reporters, journalists, cameramen and lots of his fans. Getting tickets to this event was  
very hard but I was lucky enough to get them. And it was Valentine's day, so it was way more special than anything else.

## Q4) Tell me about one of the actors who was in the news because of some issue recently. What was the issue about? How did the news effect your impression of that actor?
```
Well.. recently I heared about my favorite Hollywood actor.. Robert Downey Jr. Yeah.. the Iron Man guy..
The thing is .. he's not going to be on Avengers series any more because his guarantee is soaring way too high and it looks like  
they could not find a way to compromise. Well.. I think it's kind of sweet bitter. I mean.. it's good for him but there are tons of  
his fans who wants to see Iron Men in film. Especially, he's the most important man in film.. you know.. while some movie stars are  
obsessed with money, some Hollywood statrs don't mind as long as they are really into the role or scenario.(뉴스에 대해 들은 것.)  

For example, Jim Carrey who is also very well-known actor who played leading role in the movie "Eternal Sunshine", his guarantee was  
about 40% less than usual but he didn't mind accepting that offer since he really liked it's scenario and his rocked it!!  
(개런티 적게 받은 짐캐리)  

Even though.. he made this kind of decision.. I will be remained as one of his fan ..(나의 느낌)  
And this is all about the news .. I heared(마무리)  
```
## Q5) Could you compare the movies made today to movies you saw while you were growing up?
```
→ 과거, 현재 영화 작품들의 변화  
Yeah.. I used to watch Hollywood movies quite often when I was a kid. Because Korean movies were not very great.. The storyline of  
the moive was not very interesting and it didn't have great quality. So most people preferred to watch Hollywood movies. And I  
also did .. However, things are changed and some of them are a lot better in quality. Also, Korean movies are hitting the all-time 
record at the Korean box office. (예전 한국 영화는 별로 였다.)  

Some well-made movies are also released overseas which is pretty awesome! I guess most people could not imagine this can happen as  
I mentioned, it didn't have any solid storyline and many things were poor in quality. Nowadays, even westerners became intested in  
Asian movies and some Korean movies are big hit.(해외에서 한국 영화 개봉)  

Yeah, I think there are the biggest changes .. compared to the past.(마무리)  
```
## Q6) When you talk about movies with your friends or family members, what topics do you discuss? Why are these issues of interest or concern to you and your friends? What makes them so important? Plus, what are some important trends in the movie industry?
```
→ 영화관련 대화 주제, 최근 영화계 트렌드  
The lastest trend in the movie industry in 3D or 4D. Many movies are shot in 3D and people are becoming familiar with this.  
Some movies are released in 4D as well. Big-scale movies are shown to large screen such as the IMAX theaters.  
Many movie theater have built premium theater to follow this trend and meet needs. The trend has moved in 3D at home as well.  
So people can watch 3D movies even at home. Overall, movie technology is developing and movie-goers can enjoy it even better than before.  
Yeah. That's all about some recent trends in the movie.
