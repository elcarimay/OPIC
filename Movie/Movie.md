## Q1) What is your favorite movie genre? Why do you like those movie?
```
Yeah, my favorite movie genre? well .. it's a hard question ..I love all kinds .. because it's all different .. you know ..  
I think I like to watch all different kinds but if I have to choose, I would say I love to watch animation and sci-fi.  
First, in terms of animation movies.. I'm a huge fan of Disney movie. Because there are usually bunch of cute animal  
characters with people. And I learn certain types of lesson after that. So, my favorite animation is a Toy Story, so  
when I saw it for the first time, I was touched and I cried .. yeah, I was a very young kid so I was very impressed  
by this movie. Disney movies are usually creative and have an interesting storyline.  
Another movie genre I like is .. sci-fi, yeah .. there are so many different kinds but one of my favorite would be avengers  
story. There are so many heroes in this film, but Robert Downey Jr is absoultely my favorite, He's a great actor so  
his acting plays a big role in this movie. Also, it's solid story-line and cast make this movie even better. Anyway,  
whenever this movie is released, I have to go to the movie theater to see it. I love Robert Downey Jr. Yeah, I heard  
Avengers series is way more popular here in Korea than any other Asian countries.  
Overall, these are all about my favorite movie genre.  
```
## Q2) Tell me about the movie theater you went recently. What did you do before and after the movie?
```
I remember going to the movie theater nearby my place. Yeah, actually movie theater is only 15 minutes by car.  
Recently, I watched Korean movie called "Transformer". It is a movie about a war between robots. In particular, it is
impressive to see cars and animals commonly seen around them transform into robots.  
Anyway, what do I do before movie? Well.. I usually check movie schedule and get tickets.. I usually buy pop cones and some
drinks for my son before movie starts. After the movie, I like to walk around the shopping mall and browse things. The theater
near my home is located inside the shopping mall, so that's what I do. If I get hungry, I go to the restaurant to have lunch
or dinner. And I talk about the movie with my family. I think that's all about it!!! 
``` 
## Q3) What was the most memorable movie you watched in the past? what was it about? What was so special about the movie? Would you recommend to other people?
```
→ 가장 기억에 남는 영화, 줄거리  
There are so many movies I watched .. and they were all different .. So it's pretty much all memorable to me .. but  
I would say. Golden Slumber was the most memorable movie I watched in the past. Actually, this movie is based on Japanese novel.  
In this film, one deliveryman flees for his life after he's framed for a politican's assassination. His best friend  
betrayed him and framed him for crime. It didn't have any special effect like SF movies but pretty intense.  
Furthermore, I love 강동원 who is well-known korean actor so it was pretty good movie to me.(영화에 관한 설명)  
While I was watching this movie, I thought about trust and need to figure out who is trustworthy.(영화보고 느낀 점)
I would like to recommend this movie because it makes me think about what real relationships are like.  
```
## Q4) Tell me about one of the actors who was in the news because of some issue recently. What was the issue about? How did the news effect your impression of that actor?
```
Well.. recently I heared about my favorite Hollywood actor.. Robert Downey Jr. Yeah.. the Iron Man guy..  
The thing is .. he's not going to be on Avengers series any more because his guarantee is soaring way too high and it looks like  
they could not find a way to compromise. Well.. It's good for him but there are tons of his fans who wants to see Iron Men in this film.  
Especially, he's the most important man in film.. you know.. while some movie stars are obsessed with money, some Hollywood statrs don't  
mind as long as they are really into the role or scenario. For example, Jim Carrey who is also very well-known actor who played leading  
role in the movie "Eternal Sunshine", his guarantee was about 40% less than usual but he didn't mind accepting that offer since he really  
liked it's scenario. I became more and more a fan of him when I heard the news. And this is all about the news .. I heared
```
## Q5) Could you compare the movies made today to movies you saw while you were growing up?
```
Yeah.. I used to watch Hollywood movies quite often when I was a kid. Because Korean movies were not very great.. The storyline of  
the moive was not very interesting and it didn't have great quality. So most people preferred to watch Hollywood movies. And I  
also did .. However, things are changed and some of them are a lot better in quality. Also, Korean movies are hitting the all-time  
record at the Korean box office. Some well-made movies are also released overseas which is pretty awesome! Nowadays, even westerners became
intested in Asian movies and some Korean movies are big hit. Yeah, I think there are the biggest changes .. compared to the past.
```
## Q6) When you talk about movies with your friends or family members, what topics do you discuss? Why are these issues of interest or concern to you and your friends? What makes them so important? Plus, what are some important trends in the movie industry?
```
The lastest trend in the movie industry in 3D or 4D. Many movies are shot in 3D and people are becoming familiar with this.  
Some movies are released in 4D as well. Big-scale movies are shown to large screen such as the IMAX theaters.  
Many movie theater have built premium theater to follow this trend and meet needs. The trend has moved in 3D at home as well.  
So people can watch 3D movies even at home. Overall, movie technology is developing and movie-goers can enjoy it even better than before.  
Yeah. That's all about some recent trends in the movie.
