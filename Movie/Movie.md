##__Q1) What is your favorite movie genre? Why do you like those movie?__  
```
Yeah, my favorite movie genre? well .. it's a hard question ..
I love all kinds .. because it's all different .. you know ..
I think I like to watch all different kinds but if I have to choose, I would say I love to watch animation and sci-fi.  
First, in terms of animation movies.. I'm a huge fan of Disney movie. Because there are usually bunch of cute animal  
characters with people. And I learn certain types of lesson after that. So, my favorite animation is a Toy Story, so  
when I saw it for the first time, I was touched and I cried .. yeah, I was a very young kid so I was very impressed  
by this movie. Disney movies are usually creative and have an interesting storyline.  
Another movie genre I like is .. sci-fi, yeah .. there are so many different kinds but one of my favorite would be avengers  
story. There are so many heroes i this film, but Robert Downey Jr is absoultely my favorite, He's a great actor so  
his acting plays a big role in this movie. Also, it's solid story-line and cast make this movie even better. Anyway,  
whenever this movie is released, I have to go to the movie theatre to see it. I love Robert Downey Jr. Yeah, I heard  
Avengers series is way more popular here in Korea than any other Asian countries.  
Overall, these are all about my favorite movie genre.

##__Q2) Tell me about the movie theater you went recently. What did you do before and after the movie?__
```
I remember going to the movie theater nearby my place. Yeah, actually movie theater is only 10 minutes by walk, so I  
like to go there especially on Friday night.  
Recently, I watched Korean movie called "The Drug King". It was about one guy who got involved in drug business.  
One of my favortie Korean actor is cast in this film, so I had to see it and it wasn't too bad.  
Anyway, what do I do before movie? Well.. I usually check movie schedule and get tickets.. And my boyfriend always  
comes with me .. also, we usually buy some drinks before movie starts.. nowadays, beer is available at the theater.  
So we never forget to grab some beer!!!  
After the movie, I like to walk around the shopping mall and browse things. The theater near my home is located inside  
the shopping mall, so that's what I do. If I get hungry, I go to the restaurant to have lunch or dinner. And I talk  
about the movie with my boyfriend. I think that's all about it!!!
