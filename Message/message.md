## 1. You said in the survey that you enjoy texting your friends. Tell me who you usually send a text message. How often do you send them and when do you usually send them? Why do you usually text them? Describe your typical routine of sending text messages as much detail as possible.
```
I must say that texting has become a big part of my life.
I frequently send text messages to my wife. She feels, just like I do, that texting is just as comfortable as making a phone call.

I sometimes text my son too, but it usually takes him a while to respond — so I tend to call him more often instead.

I send text messages at any time, but especially when I can’t make or take a call, or when I’m not sure if the person I’m trying to reach is available.
Once I send a message, they can respond when it’s convenient for them, without being interrupted.

Another benefit is that texting saves money. It’s definitely cheaper than calling.
In fact, under my telecom plan, I can even send free messages to my wife.

My son also likes to send voice-to-text messages, mostly because he’s a slow typer.

Anyway, these days, texting is just as common as calling, and for me, it actually feels even more convenient and comfortable.

## 2. I guess the pattern of your text message has changed. In the past, who did you send a message to? Is it the same or has it changed? If it has changed, how is it different?
```
The pattern of sending messages hasn’t changed much, but these days, there’s a growing trend of replacing words with emoticons.
Emoticons were first created in 1982 by Scott Fahlman, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University.

Sometimes, using an emoticon is more efficient than typing out a full message.
They help make communication more concise, so we don’t need to write long or awkward sentences.
Because of this, we can deliver the same message or feeling more quickly and clearly, while keeping the conversation short and simple.

In fact, emoticons can sometimes express emotions better than words, making conversations feel more fun and expressive.

Another big change is that we can now send not only text messages, but also photos, videos, and even our location.
What a convenient world we live in! It has made communication so much easier.

That’s why more and more people prefer sending messages over making phone calls.

## 3. Do you have any unforgettable experience while sending a text message? When was it? What happened? Were you with anyone else? Please tell me everything about it.

```
My wife used to scold me when I came home from work, because I didn’t check her messages in a timely manner.
When I’m really focused on work, I tend to forget about my phone completely.
I think it’s because my brain works like a single-core processor — I can only concentrate on one thing at a time!

One day, I came home without checking any messages, and my wife looked a bit upset.
She told me she had sent a message asking what I wanted to eat for dinner, but since I didn’t reply, she just picked something on her own.
She was disappointed, not because of the food, but because I didn’t communicate with her.

After that, I started checking my phone more often during my breaks at work.
I realized that small things like replying to a message can make a big difference in a relationship.
