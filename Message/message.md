## 1. You said in the survey that you enjoy texting your friends. Tell me who you usually send a text message.<br>How often do you send them and when do you usually send them? Why do you usually text them? Describe your typical routine of sending text messages as much detail as possible.
```
I must say that texting has been a part of my life. I frequently send text messages to my wife. Usually
to my wife who feel, just like me, sending a text message is as comfortable as making a call. I sometime text
my son but it takes time to get his responses so I tend to call him more often. I send text messages
anytime but especially when I cannot make or take a call or when I am not certain whether a person who I am
supposed to call can take a call or not. Once I send a message, she or he will respond to my message without
being interrupted. Texting also saves money. It is definitely cheaper to text people than call them. Especially,
It is free to send a message to my wife according to the telecommunication company's rate system.
My son likes to send voice-altered text messages because of his slow typing.
Anyways, texting a person is as common as calling a person nowadays and to me it is even more comfortable.

## 2. I guess the pattern of your text message has changed. In the past, who did you send a message to? Is it the same or has it changed? If it has changed, how is it different?
```
The pattern of sending messages is similar to before, but these days there is a tendency to replace them
 with emoticons instead of messages. Emoticons were first made in 1982 by Scott Feyher, a computer scientist
 at Carnegie Mellon University. Sometimes it is more efficient to send a simple message without having to 
 say it in a message. In addition, emoticons have the advantage of making messages more concise so that you
 don't have to write long unfilial sentences. For this reason, it seems that the desired information can be
 effectively delivered while keeping the long conversation shorter. In particular, emoticons seem to have the
 effect of enriching expression rather than verbal expression.
Anyway, the biggest change is that I can send not only text messages but also pictures, movies, and even
your location. What a convenient world! It made my life much easier. That is why more and more people
choose to send text messages instead of calling somebody.

## 3. Do you have any unforgettable experience while sending a text message? When was it? What happened? Were you with anyone else? Please tell me everything about it.

```
My wife scolded me when I go home every day after work. Because I didn't check my cell phone message in a timely
manner. If I'm immersed in work at work, I don't care about my cell phone, but I think it's because my head is
 a single core that can't do many things and only does one thing without thinking of the characteristics of man
 and woman. I just went home without checking anything, but my wife was disappointed why I didn't check the
 message. She was asking what to eat for dinner, but she was disappointed that she just chose what she wanted
 because I didn't answer. After that, I try to check it often during breaks at work.
