## Nothing beats hard work and consistency.

## Noble, sincerity in word and deed makes you noble. Competent, you need to be able to get things done quickly and well.

## Honor, don't neglect the little things and don't be afraid of the big things.

## If you practice these four virtues, wealth will follow.

## Happiness is never far away, it's always within reach.

## It doesn't take a special person to be successful - most successful people are the ones who do the little things right form the start.

## The busiest people have the most time. Diligent work pays off in the end.
