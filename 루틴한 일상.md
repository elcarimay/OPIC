```
On weekdays, I typically wake up at 5:30 am and get ready for the day.
I take care of my small pets and I do the residual dishes.
I rinse my hair and wear my clothes.
After putting on my makeup, I prepare the English Class.
And I work
After working, I come back to my house.
I do my son's homework and taking care of my small pets and I do the dishes.
And I go to bed for sleep. It's my routinary life.
