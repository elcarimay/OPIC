```
On weekdays,  wake up at 5:30 am and start my day by taking care of your small pets
and doing the residual dishes.
After that, you rinse your hair and get dressed before putting on makeup
and preparing for English class at 6:20 am.
During the day, I work as a mechanical engineer in the office at my company.
After working, I return home to take care of son's homework and small pets.
I also make time to do the dishes before settling down for the night and going to bed.
