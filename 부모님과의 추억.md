# 아버지와의 추억
```
My father was strict. I always had to bow to adults.
I was scolded for my rude behavior or speech.
He was far from caring, but he retired as a civil servant.
One day, I went to my grandfather's house, and my father told me that you shouldn't eat it first before an adult ate,
and he scolded me a lot when I ate all the tangerines by myself.
At that time, it was a little unfair to say something about food, but I understood it a little when I was a adult.
