# I'd like to know about one of the issues parks are facing. what are some problems? What can we do to resolve the issue?

One problem that many parks face these days is littering.
Some people visit the park and leave trash behind, which makes the park look dirty and can harm the environment and local wildlife.
Litter can also attract animals like rats or raccoons, which might be dangerous for people using the park.

To solve this problem, I think itâ€™s important to help people understand why proper waste disposal matters.
For example, parks can put up signs to remind visitors not to litter.
Also, park staff can collect trash more frequently and make sure there are enough trash cans and recycling bins placed in visible and convenient locations.

If we all make an effort to keep parks clean, they can remain safe, pleasant, and enjoyable spaces for everyone.
