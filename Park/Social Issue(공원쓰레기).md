# I'd like to know about one of the issues parks are facing. what are some problems? What can we do to resolve the issue?

One problem that many parks have these days is littering. Some people go to the park and leave trash behind. This makes the park look dirty and can also be bad for the environment and animals living there. Litter can even attract animals like rats or raccoons, which might be dangerous for people visiting the park.

To fix this problem, I think it's important to help people understand why they should throw their trash away properly. For example, parks can put up signs to remind people not to litter. Also, park workers can collect trash more often and make sure there are enough trash cans and recycling bins in easy-to-see places.

If we all try to keep parks clean, they will stay nice and safe for everyone to enjoy.
