# I'd like to know about one of the issues parks are facing. what are some problems? What can we do to resolve the issue?
```
One of the issues that parks are facing is the problem of littering. Unfortunately, many people visit parks
and leave behind trash, which not only ruins the aesthetic appeal of the park, but also poses a threat to
the environment and wildlife in the area. Littering can also attract pests, such as rats and raccoons,
which can be dangerous to park visitors.

To resolve this issue, it is important to encourage park visitors to take responsibility for their trash
and dispose of it properly. This can be done through education and awareness campaigns, such as signs
that remind visitors to properly dispose of their trash. Additionally, park staff can increase the
frequency of trash pick-up and recycling containers more easily accessible to visitors.
By working together to address this issue, we can help keep our parks clean and beautiful for visitors.
