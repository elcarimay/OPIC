→ 공원에 대한 소개  
Yeah ~ I like to go to the park because there is very big lake park nearby my place.  
And, actually it's one of the best parks in my neighborhood. Because there are many 
things to do like a big tennis court, soccer field, mini golf course and a playground for kids.  
Also, there is a dog park so many people walk their dogs to this park. Furthermore, the lake 
at this park is unbelievable/breathtaking.

And I usually go there to walk because I like to get some exercise while getting some fresh air.  
And this park is just across the street from my place, so it's really convenient for me to get there.  
So I go there almost every night. Because I like to lose some weight. I have a dog and it's a perfect  
place for my pup.  
→ 공원에서 일어나는 일들  
At this park, many special events are held like a flea market, outdoor cinema and live concerts and there  
are much more. And flea markets are held throughout the year / all year around except the winter.  
For example, a flea market is held every weekend so this place is usually packed on weekend. So  
I like to browse even through I don't need anything.

Well.. let me think.. actually my brother lost lots of weight after he started going to the park  
because he was seriously fat.. no kidding .. so all of my family was worried about his health.  
But he didn't care much about his health. However, one day he decided to lose weight since he  
could not find his size at the clothing store. I guess it would be heartbreaking experience.  
Anyway after that, he began to go to the park and walked every night. He never missed even a day.  
Actually, he took me to the park one time but I gave up soon since I was exhausted after that  
and what happend was .. After 1 year, he lost about 20 kg and I was shocked ..
That's why I decided to go to the park. Honestly, I kinda regretted after I saw him waling because  
I also thought that I could lose some weight and become skinny if I went with him.
