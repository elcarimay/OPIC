→ 공원에 대한 소개  
Yeah ~ I like to go to the park because there is very big park nearby my place.  
And, actually it's one of the best parks in my neighborhood. Because there are many 
things to do like a soccer field, a basketball field and a playground for kids. Also, there is a dog
park so many people walk their dogs to this park. And There is a fountain in the middle, and you can
sometimes see a fountain show with music on Friday evenings.

And I usually go there to walk because I like to get some exercise while getting some fresh air.  
And this park is just across the street from my place, so it's really convenient for me to get there.  
So I go there almost every weekends. Because I like to exercise with my son.

At this park, many special events are held like a flea market, scoccer game. And flea markets are held
throughout the year. For example, a flea market is held every weekend so this place is usually packed
on weekend. So I like to browse even through I don't need anything.

→ 건강관련 이야기로 꾸미기!!  
Well.. let me think.. actually my brother lost lots of weight after he started going to the park  
because he was seriously fat.. no kidding .. so all of my family was worried about his health.  
But he didn't care much about his health. However, one day he decided to lose weight since he  
could not find his size at the clothing store. I guess it would be heartbreaking experience.  
Anyway after that, he began to go to the park and walked every night. He never missed even a day.  
Actually, he took me to the park one time but I gave up soon since I was exhausted after that  
and what happend was .. After 1 year, he lost about 20 kg and I was shocked ..
That's why I decided to go to the park. Honestly, I regretted after I saw him walking because  
I also thought that I could lose some weight and become skinny if I went with him.

## __Q3) Tell me about a memorable experience that happened at the park. What exactly happened, and how did you deal with the situation? What made that event so memorable? Give me all the details.__

*가족과 텐트치고 공원에서 좋은 시간 보냄.  
*남친과 자전거 빌려서 탐(원피스 입은 날)  
A memorable experience at the park? Well.. I remember my last summer.. I went to the park called  
Han River .. which is located in Seoul city and it's a huge river park .. so many people visit  
there just to have a great time. The night view is absolutely amazing so it's a great spot to  
hang out especially in summer time. So, I went there with my boyfriend because we had nothing  
to do that day as I remember. We didn't have any plan after having lunch, so we just decided to go  
there and we ended up renting a bicycle there and the problem was .. I'm not a bicycle person, so  
As I told you, we didn't plan to go there so I was wearing a long dress which is not appropriate outfit  
to ride a bicycle .. anyway.. I didn't want to disappoint him so I just lied to him that riding a bicycle  
is not a problem .. but what happened was I struggled a lot after that .. there were too many people behind  
me and I blocked their way so they wanted me to go faster furthermore, road was so narrow right next to  
the riverside. Anyway, it was such a horrible nightmare to me. I damaged my dress and he got upset. 
You ever heard "It never rains, but pours?" .. that's what I happened to me at the park.
