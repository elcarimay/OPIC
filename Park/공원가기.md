→ 공원에 대한 소개  
Yeah ~ I like to go to the park because there is very big park nearby my place.  
And, actually it's one of the best parks in my neighborhood. Because there are many 
things to do like a soccer field, a basketball field and a playground for kids. Also, there is a dog
park so many people walk their dogs to this park. And There is a fountain in the middle, and you can
sometimes see a fountain show with music on Friday evenings.

And I usually go there to walk because I like to get some exercise while getting some fresh air.  
And this park is just across the street from my place, so it's really convenient for me to get there.  
So I go there almost every weekends. Because I like to exercise with my son.

At this park, many special events are held like a flea market, scoccer game. And flea markets are held
throughout the year. For example, a flea market is held every weekend so this place is usually packed
on weekend. So I like to browse even through I don't need anything.

## Q2) How did you first start going to parks? What made you visit parks in the first place? Why do you go to parks now? Tell me how your interest in going to the parks changed over the years. Give me all the details.  
```
When I was young, I went to the park with my parents or did sports events such as picnics. These days,
sports and convenience facilities have been deveoped. I go to the park to play with my child because it
is well done. I have a lot of things to do, such as basketball, soccer, and riding a bicycle.
My son like to play soccer the most, especially he like to break through one to one. But I like to pass
each other. So we decided to do half and half. Usually after soccer, I buy ice cream and drink at
convenience store to cool off our sweat.

## Q3) Tell me about a memorable experience that happened at the park. What exactly happened, and how did you deal with the situation? What made that event so memorable? Give me all the details.
```
A memorable experience at the park? Well.. Last week, my family went to the lake park for a walk after dinner.
As if there was an event, many people were sitting on the stairs or grass around the lake, so I searched
and found out that there was a fountain show. So I was going to watch a fountain show, but my son thought
it would be boring, so he just asked me to go home. After much consideration, I persuaded him to watch
the show because I would buy him a strawberry delicious shake. It was fortunate that he was still young
and weak at eating. I bought a strawberry shake and a latte and sat on the stairs nearby waiting for the show.
A few minutes later, the fountain show began on a midsummer night, and it was a wonderful performance with
colorful lights, fog, and music, not just shooting water. It was so much fun and I liked being with my family.
It is an unforgettable memory in the park. That's what I happened to me at the park.
