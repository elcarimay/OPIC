## Q1) You indicated that you like to go to parks. Tell me about one of the parks that you often visit. What does it look like? Tell me what people do at the park.  
```
Yes, I like going to the park because there's a really big one near my place.
Actually, it's one of the best parks in my neighborhood. It has many great spots like a soccer field, a basketball court, and a playground for kids.
There's also a dog park, so many people walk their pets there.
In the center of the park, there's a fountain, and sometimes you can even watch a fountain show with music on Friday evenings.

I usually go there to take a walk because I enjoy getting some exercise while breathing fresh air.
The park is just across the street from my home, so it's very convenient.
That’s why I go there almost every weekend and enjoy exercising with my son.

Also, many special events are held in this park, like flea markets and soccer games.
Flea markets happen all year round, especially on weekends, so the park is usually crowded at that time.
Even if I don’t need anything, I still like to walk around and look.
It has already become my go-to place, and I’m sure I’ll go there again with my son this weekend.

## Q2) How did you first start going to parks? What made you visit parks in the first place? Why do you go to parks now? Tell me how your interest in going to the parks changed over the years. Give me all the details.  
```
When I was young, I always go to the park with my parents or did sports events such as picnics. Recently,
sports and convenience facilities have been developed. I usually go to the park to play with my child because
it is well constructed.I have a lot of things to do, such as basketball, soccer, and riding a bicycle.

A breakthrough means that one player passes the ball to another. We like to pass it on with each other.
We decided to do it alternately for 2 hours. Sometimes, I buy ice cream and drinks after playing soccer.
```
## Q3) Tell me about a memorable experience that happened at the park. What exactly happened, and how did you deal with the situation? What made that event so memorable? Give me all the details.
```
A memorable experience I had at the park was last week, when my family went for a walk around the lake
after dinner. I felt that there was an event, and many people were sitting on the stairs or grass around, so
I searched and found out that there was a fountain show. I was going to watch it, but my son thought it
would be boring, so he just asked me to go home. 

After much consideration, I persuaded him to watch the show. I offered to buy him a delicious strawberry
shake if he will go with me. It was fortunate that he is still young and doesn't eat too much. I bought him
a strawberry shake and a latte for me. We sat on the stairs nearby, waiting for the show to start.
A few minutes later, the fountain show began midsummer night. It was a wonderful sight to behold with
colorful lights, smoke, music and not just plain moving water. It was so much fun, and I like being with
my family. It was an unforgettable memory in the park. That's what happened to me during that memorable
experience.
