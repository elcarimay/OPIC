## Q1) You indicated that you like to go to parks. Tell me about one of the parks that you often visit. What does it look like? Tell me what people do at the park.  
```
Yes, I like going to the park because there's a really big one near my place.
Actually, it's one of the best parks in my neighborhood. It has many great spots like a soccer field, a basketball court, and a playground for kids.
There's also a dog park, so many people walk their pets there.
In the center of the park, there's a fountain, and sometimes you can even watch a fountain show with music on Friday evenings.

I usually go there to take a walk because I enjoy getting some exercise while breathing fresh air.
The park is just across the street from my home, so it's very convenient.
That’s why I go there almost every weekend and enjoy exercising with my son.

Also, many special events are held in this park, like flea markets and soccer games.
Flea markets happen all year round, especially on weekends, so the park is usually crowded at that time.
Even if I don’t need anything, I still like to walk around and look.
It has already become my go-to place, and I’m sure I’ll go there again with my son this weekend.

## Q2) How did you first start going to parks? What made you visit parks in the first place? Why do you go to parks now? Tell me how your interest in going to the parks changed over the years. Give me all the details.  
```
When I was young, I used to go to the park with my parents, and we often had picnics or joined sports events.
These days, many parks have improved a lot, with better sports and convenience facilities.
Now, I usually go to the park to play with my child because it’s well-maintained and has many things to do.
We can play basketball, soccer, or ride bicycles together.

When we play soccer, we enjoy passing the ball back and forth.
We even made a rule to take turns playing for about two hours.
After we finish playing, we sometimes buy ice cream or drinks to cool down.
```
## Q3) Tell me about a memorable experience that happened at the park. What exactly happened, and how did you deal with the situation? What made that event so memorable? Give me all the details.
```
A memorable experience I had at the park was just last week, when my family went for a walk around the lake after dinner.
While we were walking, I noticed that something was going on—many people were sitting on the stairs or relaxing on the grass.
I got curious, so I checked online and found out that there was going to be a fountain show.

I wanted to watch it, but my son said it would be boring and asked to go home instead.
After thinking for a bit, I decided to persuade him. I promised to buy him a delicious strawberry shake if he stayed to watch the show with me.
Luckily, he’s still young and doesn’t eat that much, so it worked! I bought him the shake and got a latte for myself.
We sat on the stairs nearby and waited for the show to start.

A few minutes later, the fountain show began under the midsummer night sky.
It was amazing—with colorful lights, music, smoke, and water dancing to the beat.
It wasn’t just plain water; it felt like a real performance. I had such a great time, and I really enjoyed being there with my family.
It became an unforgettable memory for me, and I’m so glad we stayed.
