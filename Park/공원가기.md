→ 공원에 대한 소개  
Yeah ~ I like to go to the park because there is very big lake park nearby my place.  
And, actually it's one of the best parks in my neighborhood. Because there are many 
things to do like a big tennis court, soccer field, mini golf course and a playground for kids.  
Also, there is a dog park so many people walk their dogs to this park. Furthermore, the lake 
at this park is unbelievable/breathtaking.
