## Q1) Tell me about the last time you used SNS using the internet. What website was it? What did you use on this SNS website? Tell me about your experience as much as you can.
```
Well, the last time I used social media? Actually, it was about an hour ago.
I check Instagram quite often, and these days, I use it even more than before.

I think it’s pretty cool because I can check my friends’ updates and stay in touch with them.
Also, there are tons of fun and interesting video clips.
I’m especially interested in traveling, so I follow travel accounts to discover the best places to go on vacation.
It’s been really helpful for planning future trips.

Of course, some people worry about privacy and personal information, but I still enjoy using social media overall.
It helps me stay updated, and it’s also a great way to kill time when I have a few minutes to spare.

Yeah, that’s why I use social media so frequently.

## Q2) How did you use the internet to get a project done in the past? When was it? What was the project about? Give me all the details.
```
Well, actually, I use the internet all the time — not just for my projects, but for almost everything,
like online banking, online shopping, reading news articles, and much more.

But when it comes to working on my projects, I totally rely on the internet to find the best resources.
Since I work for Samsung Display, staying up-to-date with the latest information is essential.
That’s why my team often assigns me tasks that require researching current market trends and industry updates online.

Honestly, it’s quite challenging because this industry changes faster than almost any other field.
So I constantly need to stay informed and updated with the latest news and developments.

For these reasons, using the internet has become a daily routine at work, and now I really can’t imagine doing my job without it.

Yeah, that’s how I use the internet for my projects.

## Q3) What are some issues people talk about regarding the internet? What are their concerns, and why are those concerns a problem? Are security problems on the internet a problem? If so, talk about that issue.  
```
Well, when it comes to issues related to the internet, there’s a lot to talk about.
But I think the biggest problem is online security.

As technology has developed, most people now use the internet in their daily lives — for things like online banking, email, shopping, and more.
So naturally, people have multiple online accounts, which makes them vulnerable to security issues like data leaks or hacking.

As I remember, one of the biggest internet websites in Korea was hacked a few years ago, and a huge amount of personal information was leaked.
Even though Korea is known for having a strong online security system, hackers managed to break through the firewall and steal the data of around 25 million people.
It was a huge news story at the time.

Also, many people use social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which are extremely popular.
But still, there are risks. For example, someone could steal your photos and use them as their own without your permission — and you might never even know.

So yeah, I think online security is definitely one of the biggest issues we face when it comes to using the internet.
