## Q1) Tell me about the last time you used SNS using the internet. What website was it? What did you use on this SNS website? Tell me about your experience as much as you can.
```
Well, the last time I used social media? Actually, it was about an hour ago. I check Instagram quite often / frequently.  
Actually I used to use facebook, but nowadays I used Instagram more than before. I think it's pretty cool as  
I can check my friends current status and keep in touch with him. Also, I can see lots of cool video clips.  
Yeah, I'm really into travelling. So I can see the best spot to go on a vacation and it's been really helpful  
so far. Even through some people are worried about personal information and many other things, I still enjoy  
using it so far. As I use this social media, I feel updated and it's a great way to kill time when I have a  
spare time. Yeah, that's why I use social media frequently.

## Q2) How did you use the internet to get a project done in the past? When was it? What was the project about? Give me all the details.
```
Well, actually I use the internet all the time not only for my project but pretty much for everything such as  
onlie banking, online shopping, reading news articles and many other things. But when I work on my project,  
I totally rely on the internet to find out the best resources. So my last project was about research about phone.  
Since I work for Samsung display, newest information is very essential / crucial. So my team always assign me to   
do some work using the internet to find out current trend in the market. Yeah, honestly, it's been challenging  
since this industry changes much faster than any other fields. So I have to always get updated with current  
issues and lastest news. For these reasons, using the internet became part of my routine at my work and now  
I can't imagine doing anything without the internet. Yeah, that's how I used the internent for my project.
```
## Q3) What are some issues people talk about regarding the internet? What are their concerns, and why are those concerns a problem? Are security problems on the internet a problem? If so, talk about that issue.  
```
Well, some issues regarding the internet? There are so much to talk about.. I think.. but the biggest problem  
would be the security thing. You know.. as technology have been developed, most people use the internet for  
many things in their routine. For example, people use online banking, email, shopping all these things using  
the internet. So, they have their own online account and it can be related to security issues.  
Yeah .. as I remember, one of the biggest internet website in Korea had hacked so lots information was leaked  
after that .. Even though Korea has a very secure/strong online security system, hackers broke through strong  
firewall and stole information of 25 million people and it was a big news in Korea about 2 yeats ago. Also,  
people use social media like facebook and instagram which are the most popular. You never know .. some people  
would have stolen your photo and use as their photos. I guess it's one thing we have to be afraid of ..  
Anyway, security is the one of the issues regarding the internet.
