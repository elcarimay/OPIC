Many young people in Korea desire to work for well-established companies, often referred to as "big companies".
Some of the most popular companies are Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and SK Group.
There are several reasons why young people in Korea want to work for these companies.
One is the perception(지각) that these companies offer stability and job security(직업보장), which is particularly important
given the competitive job market in Korea. In addition, these companies often offer high salaries and generous
benefits packages, which can be very attractive to young job seekers.
Another reason why these companies are popular is that they are seen as offering opportunities for career
advancement and professional development. Many young Koreans view working for a large company as a way to
gain valuable experience and build their resume, which can help them in their future careers.

One of the rising industries in Korea is the video game industry, which has been growing steadily in recently.
One of the most successful companies in this industry is Nexon, a South Korean gaming company that was founded in 1994.
Nexon is known for creating popular online games such as MapleStory and KartRider, which have gained a large following both
in Korea and internationally. One of the reasons why Nexon has been so successful is because they were early adopters of the
free-to-play business model, which allows players to download and play the games for free, but charges for in-game items or features.
Overall, Nexon is a company that has gained a reputation for its innovative business model, successful video games. As the video game
industry continues to grow in Korea and around the world, Nexon is well-positioned to remain a major player in the market.

# Talk about some difficulties or challenges of the industry you mentioned before. What are some difficuties?
```
While the video game industry in Korea has been growing rapidly, there are also some challenges in this industry face.
One of the main difficulties is the great competition in the market. There are many game companies in Korea, and new ones are
constantly emerging(최근 생겨난), which makes it harder for companies to stand out and succeed.
Another challenge is the changing preferences of gamers. As technology advances and new gaming platforms emerge, gamers' preferences
can shift quickly, making it difficult for game companies to keep up and create games that will remain popular for a long time.
In addition, there is increasing concern(우려) about video game addiction(게임중독) and its negative effects on young people, which
has led to calls for strict regulations on the industry.
Finally, as the industry becomes more globalized, game companies in Korea must compete with international companies, which can be
challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences, and other factors.

"Samsung pay"  
People don't need to carry their credit card any more. Because we can pay anything with our phone.  
Basically, it's like a my credit card is installed on my phone. So, whenever I need to pay, I need to open the app  
called "Samsung pay", which is pretty similar with " Apple pay". It's one example of digital wallet service.
