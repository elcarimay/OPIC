# Talk about some difficulties or challenges of the industry you mentioned before. What are some difficuties?
```
While the video game industry in Korea has been growing rapidly, there are also some challenges in this industry face.
One of the main difficulties is the great competition in the market. There are many game companies in Korea, and new ones are
constantly emerging(최근 생겨난), which makes it harder for companies to stand out and succeed.
Another challenge is the changing preferences of gamers. As technology advances and new gaming platforms emerge, gamers' preferences
can shift quickly, making it difficult for game companies to keep up and create games that will remain popular for a long time.
In addition, there is increasing concern(우려) about video game addiction(게임중독) and its negative effects on young people, which
has led to calls for strict regulations on the industry.
Finally, as the industry becomes more globalized, game companies in Korea must compete with international companies, which can be
challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences, and other factors.
