# Have you ever bought tickets, but couldn't make it because something unexpected happened?
```
About twelve years ago, I bought a movie tickets. At the day of screening, I was going to
the movie theater. But I couldn't go. I received a call that my father got hurt while
going down the stairs. So I went to my and looked at how sick he was.
My father wore a cast because his ankles overlapped.
