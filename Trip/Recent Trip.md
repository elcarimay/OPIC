# Do you remember recent trip? What did you do? What was the special thing in your trip?

I went to Saipan, a small island in the western Pacific Ocean.
During the trip, I enjoyed the beautiful beaches and crystal-clear waters, and I went snorkeling to explore the colorful underwater world around Managaha Island.

I also visited some historic sites, including World War II battlefields and memorials, which gave me a chance to learn more about the island’s history.

But the most special part of the trip was the chance to see the amazing starlit sky at night.
I lay down on a mat with my family and just looked up. It felt like the stars were falling down toward us — the sky was filled with so many of them.
I was deeply moved by the beautiful scenery, and in that moment, I felt truly grateful to be with my family.

It’s a memory I’ll never forget.
