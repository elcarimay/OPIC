# Do you remember recent trip? What did you do? What was the special thing in your trip?
```
I went to Saipan, a small island in the western Pacific Ocean. During the trip,
I enjoyed the beautiful beaches and crystal clear waters, and went snorkeling to
explore the colorful underwater world in the Managaha island. I also visited some
historic sites, such as World War II battlefields and memorials.

The most special thing about my trip was the opportunity to witness a lot of starlights.
I lay down on a mat and watched it with my family. I felt like lots of stars were going down to me.
I was impressed by the beautiful scenary. And I felt grateful to be with my family.
