## Q1) You indicated that you like to go on trips domestically. Tell me about places you like to visit the most. Why do you like to visit that place? Describe that location in as much as detail as possible.
```
Yes, I love going on trips.
There are so many beautiful places to visit in Korea, which is well known as a peninsula.

I’ve traveled to many places around the country, so it’s hard to choose just one.
But if I had to pick, I’d say my favorite is Gangwon Province, which is about a 2-hour drive from Dongtan.
It’s not that close, but I still love going there.

Gangwon is part of the Eastern Sea, and the water there is especially clean and deep, which is one of the reasons I enjoy visiting so much.
There are many beaches in the area, but I usually go to Jukdo Beach, which is one of the most popular surfing spots.

During the summer, it gets quite crowded with tourists, but I don’t mind.
When I visit, I usually bring a tent, some camp chairs, and snacks to enjoy by the beach.
There are also many fun activities you can try, like surfing or just relaxing by the sea.

That’s all about the place I love to visit the most.

## Q2) Talk about a trip you went on in your childhood. What do you remember about that trip? Where did you go, and whom did you go with? What made the trip so special?
```
I remember going to Mallipo Beach with my family when I was a kid.
During the day, we swam in the ocean, and I loved playing in the sand.
I used to make sandcastles, but my brother would always show up and destroy them suddenly, which was both funny and a little annoying.

I also enjoyed burying my cousin in the sand — we really had a great time together.

Let me tell you about the food, too.
My mom was always well-prepared, and she always brought homemade gimbap.
It was the perfect food for a beach picnic, and my family loved it.

But the best part of the trip was the sunset.
Since Mallipo is on the west coast, the sunset was absolutely stunning.
It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen, even now.

Yeah, that’s all about my childhood trip — a really special memory for me.
```
## Q3) Unexpected things can happen on trips. Talk about unforgettable incident that happened on a trip. Why was the experience so memorable? Give me all the details
```
I remember a time when I traveled to Jeju Island in the spring, and something unforgettable happened — it took place on the plane.

Everyone had already checked in, and we were all seated, ready for takeoff.
I was really excited because it had been a while since my last trip.
But just before we were about to depart, one passenger suddenly asked to get off the plane.

I overheard that her son was crying a lot because he had acrophobia — a fear of heights.
I guess she wanted to let him try flying for the first time, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out.

After some discussion between the flight attendants and the pilots, they decided to let her and her son leave the plane.
She apologized many times to the passengers, but honestly, it was still very frustrating.
We were stuck in the cabin for about two hours, and it really felt like a waste of time.

It was such a rare and unexpected situation, and I even thought it should’ve been on the news.
After she left, we finally took off and headed to Jeju.

Even though the rest of the trip was great, that incident was so unusual that I’ll never forget it.
```
## Q4) What are some things you do in order to prepare for trips?
```
Well, before I go on a trip, I usually Google information about the destination.
I consider many things like the weather, local restaurants, and accommodations, so I can plan ahead and have a quality time with my family.

While some people enjoy traveling without much planning, I prefer to research the place in advance.
I like to find out where it’s located, what’s nearby, and what the must-see spots are.
After that, I usually make a packing list to make sure I don’t forget anything important.

To be honest, I’m a bit of a heavy packer. I tend to bring a lot of stuff when I travel.
I also go on a bit of a shopping spree before trips. I usually stop by a mall near my office after work to get what I need.

For example, I buy things like a swimsuit, sunscreen, and waterproof ziplock bags for my belongings.
These small items really help me enjoy the trip more comfortably.

So yeah, that’s what I usually do when I prepare for a trip.
```
## Q5) You indicated in the survey that you take vacation domestically, Most people say that travel has become more difficult  in the past 5 years, Tell me what types of changes you have observed when travelling and how these changes affected travelers or traveler's experiences.
```
Honestly, I don’t think traveling has become more difficult than in the past.
In fact, I believe it has become much easier and more convenient.

First of all, there are more transportation options available now compared to before.
For example, there’s a new express train called the SRX. It’s a bit cheaper, faster, and more modern than other trains.
Luckily, the station is not far from my place, so I use it often. It’s clean, efficient, and very convenient.

In addition, there are more affordable flight options than before.
These low-cost carriers don’t offer food or drinks, but the ticket prices are very reasonable.
That’s why many people take advantage of them — and I’m one of them.
I actually flew to Jeju Island for just 90,000 won round-trip, which was a great deal.

Also, driving has become easier thanks to GPS.
Almost every driver uses a navigation app on their smartphone now.
It shows the fastest route to the destination, helps avoid traffic, and saves a lot of time.
Honestly, I can’t imagine driving without GPS anymore.

So overall, I think traveling has become much easier, not more difficult.
```
## Q6) What are some issues or concerns people have related to taveling? What do people do to address those issues or concerns?.
```
Well, when it comes to traveling, I think safety is the biggest concern.
People can easily get injured or sick while traveling, so I believe it’s important to take precautions to stay safe.

For instance, when people are near water or doing water activities, they need to follow safety guidelines.
Some people jump into the water without warming up, and they end up getting cramps.
This can be very dangerous, and in the worst case, it can even lead to drowning.

I also think travelers should avoid dangerous areas, especially when they’re abroad.
Some people like to visit places where local residents live, but sometimes these areas are not safe for tourists.
I wouldn’t recommend going outside of secured tourist zones, because it could lead to unexpected trouble.

For these reasons, I think safety is the number one thing people worry about when they travel.
