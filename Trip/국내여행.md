## Q1) You indicated that you like to go on trips domestically. Tell me about places you like to visit the most. Why do you like to visit that place? Describe that location in as much as detail as possible.
```
Yes, I love to go on a trip and there are so many beautiful places to visit in Korea. Because Korea is a peninsula.  
And I have been to most parts of Korea. So it's hard to choose only one .. but if I have to .. I would say it's Gangwon  
province which is located about 2 hours away from Dongtan by car. It's not that close but I love to there. Actually,  
it's part of the Estern Sea so it's water color is very clean and deep. That's why I love to be there. There are several  
different kinds of beaches but I usually go to Jukdo beach. It's one of the most popular surfing spots in this area so   
there are usually many people especially in the summer. When I go there, I usually bring my tent, camp chairs and some  
snacks to eat. Anyway, there are so many more things to enjoy. There are all about the place I visit the most.
```
## Q2) Talk about a trip you went on in your childhood. What do you remember about that trip? Where did you go, and whom did you go with? What made the trip so special?
```
I remember going to 만리포 beach with my family when I was a kid. During the day, we swam in the ocean, and I liked to play with the  
sand on the beach. I used to make a sand castle but my brother showed up suddenly and destroyed it. Also, I like to bury my cousin  
in the sand so we had a great time. Anyway, let me tell about what we ate. My mother are always well-prepared, so she cooked a Gimbap  
It was just perfect food to my family. The best part of this trip was sunset since this area is part of the Western Sea, the sunset  
is absolutely amazing! Yeah, it was one of the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. There are all about my trip as a child.
```
## Q3) Unexpected things can happen on trips. Talk about unforgettable incident that happened on a trip. Why was the experience so memorable? Give me all the details
```
I remember a time when I went to Jeju Island in Spring. And this thing happened there on the plane. Everybody checked in and we were
ready to take off. I was so excited since it's been a while. And what happened was .. one passenger wanted to get off a plane right
before departure. As I heard, her son was crying a lot because of acrophobia. I guess she was not supposed to take him to the trip.
But maybe she wanted him to try once but it didn't work. Anyway, after flight attendants and pilots duscussed, they decided to let her
go but it was very annoying .. and the passenger apologized many times to everybody .. but it was not enough ..you know because everybody
had to stay in cabin for 2 hours. It was kinda waste of time. It was unbelievable because it rarely happens after she left, we could
finally leave to Jeju island. I thought it should be on the news. That's why I cannot forget this / That's why it's unforgettable.
```
## Q4) What are some things you do in order to prepare for trips?
```
Well.. before I go on a trip, I usually search for some information / I google about the destination. Things about weather, local
restaurants and accommodations. So I can plan well and spend a quality time. While some people just go and like to discover what's
around that area, I would rather study about that area. After googling, I make a list of things I need to bring .. also where to go.
Actually, I pack tons of things when I go on a trip since I am a heavy packer. And I guess I'm not the only one who goes for a shopping
before trip.. So I like to go to the mall near my office, so I usually stop by there after work to get some stuff I need like a swimsuit,
cosmetics .. thing like that. Yeah, that's pretty much I do when I prepare for trips.
```
## Q5) You indicated in the survey that you take vacation domestically, Most people say that travel has become more difficult  in the past 5 years, Tell me what types of changes you have observed when travelling and how these changes affected travelers or traveler's experiences.
```
Honestly, I don't think it's been more difficult than in the past, In fact, travelling has become more easier. First of all, there are more transportation than before. For example, new express trian called SRX is available. It's little cheaper, faster and newer. And this train
station is not that far from my place. So I took this train when I went to my friend's wedding to other city. It was clean, fast and convenient.
Also, in terms of changes, there are much more low fare airlines / low-cost carriers / cheap flights than before. So basically this kind of flight
doesn't serve any food or drinks but it's price is reasonable. So many people take advantage of this. And I'm also one of them. So actually
I took a flight to Jeju and paid only 90,000 for a round-trip ticket which was a great deal.
Plus, driving has become much easier and faster because GPS system. It's really conveient so most drivers use their GPS with their phone
which shows them the fastest way. I guess I am so spoiled because I cannot imagine driving without GPS nowadays.
Anyway, so I think travelling has become a lot easier.. rather than more difficult.
```
## Q6) What are some issues or concerns people have related to taveling? What do people do to address those issues or concerns?.
```
Well in terms of traveling I guess safety is the biggest concern/issue. Because people could get injured or get sick while they are travelling.
So, I believe people should take precautions to be safe. For instance, when people are near water, they have to make sure to follow
the rules. For example, some people don't warm up before they go into to water so they get cramps so they can be drowned seriously.
Also, I believe people should not visit dangerous area. Some people just like to visit where local people live especially overseas.
I would not recommand that because they can get in trouble. Getting out of touristic area can be dangerous to travelers.
For those reasons, I think safety is the thing people are worried about.
