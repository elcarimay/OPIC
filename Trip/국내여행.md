## Q1) You indicated that you like to go on trips domestically. Tell me about places you like to visit the most. Why do you like to visit that place? Describe that location in as much as detail as possible.
```
Yes, I love to go on a trip and there are so many beautiful places to visit in my country / Korea. Because Korea is a peninsula.  
And I have been to most parts of Korea / I didn't have a chance to visit many places / I have been to only several places.  
So it's hard to choose only one .. but if I have to .. I would say it's Gangwon province which is located about 2 hours away from Seoul  
by car. It's not that close but I love to there. Actually, it's part of the Estern Sea so it's water color is very clean and deep.  
That's why I love to be there. There are several different kinds of beaches but I usually go to Jukdo beach. It's one of the most  
popular surfing spots in this area so there are usually many people especially in the summer. Also, it's pet-friendly beach  
so I can bring my dog with me. When I go there, I usually bring my dron, tent, camp chairs and some snacks to eat.  
So I can take pictures of nice view while I'm drinking beer. I usually go there once a month  in the summer and chill out.(hang out)  
For the last, there is really famous
