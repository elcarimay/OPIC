## Q1) You indicated that you like to go on trips domestically. Tell me about places you like to visit the most. Why do you like to visit that place? Describe that location in as much as detail as possible.
```
Yes, I love to go on a trip. There are so many beautiful places to visit in Korea and it is known as a peninsula.
I have been to many places around the country so it's hard to choose only one. If I have to, I would say it's
Gangwon province which is located in Dongtan 2 hours away drive by car. It's not that near but I love to go there.
Actually, it's part of the Eastern Sea so it's water color is very clean and deep that's why I love it.
There are different kinds of beaches but I usually go to Jukdo beach which is one of the most popular
surfing spots in this area. There are usually a lot  tourist especially during summer. When I go there, I usually
bring my tent, camp chairs and some snacks to eat. As a matter of fact, there are many activities to enjoy.
 That's all about the place I love to visit the most.

## Q2) Talk about a trip you went on in your childhood. What do you remember about that trip? Where did you go, and whom did you go with? What made the trip so special?
```
I remember going to 만리포 beach with my family when I was a kid. During the day, we swam in the ocean,
and I liked to play sand on the beach. I used to make sandcastles back then, but, my brother always show up
and destroy it suddenly. I also liked to bury my cousin in the sand so we really had a great time. On top of that,
I'll tell you about the food we ate. My mother is always well-prepared, and she always cook Gimbap.
It was a perfect food for my family. The best part of this trip was the sunset since this area is part of the Western Sea.
The sunset is absolutely amazing! Yeah, it was one of the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
That's all about my trip as a child.
```
## Q3) Unexpected things can happen on trips. Talk about unforgettable incident that happened on a trip. Why was the experience so memorable? Give me all the details
```
I remember a time when I went to Jeju Island in Spring. This unforgettable incident happened on the plane. 
Everybody checked in and we were ready to take off. I was so excited since it's been a while and what
happened was one passenger wanted to get off a plane right before departure. I overheard her son 
crying a lot because of acrophobia. I guess she was not supposed to take him to the trip but she
wanted him to try it once but it didn't work. Anyway, after flight attendants and pilots discussed the matter over , they decided
to let her go.It was very annoying and the passenger had apologized many times to everyone. It wasn't enough because
we had stayed in the cabin for 2 hours. It was such a waste of time. It was unbelievable because it rarely happens.
After she left, we could finally depart to Jeju island. I thought it should be on the news that's why I can't forget this.
```
## Q4) What are some things you do in order to prepare for trips?
```
Well, before I go on a trip, I usually google about the destination.  I also consider a lot of things such as the weather,
local restaurants and accommodations so I can plan well and spend a quality time with my family. While other
people love to travel in a rush, I'd rather study or check the place I'm going to visit first and find out its location or
what's around that area. After doing it, I would make a list of things I need to bring. As a matter of fact, I usually
pack a lot of things when I go on a trip. I am a heavy packer. I guess I'm not the only one who goes on a shopping
spree before trip. I like to go to the mall near my office. I usually stop by after work to get stuffs such as swimsuit,
 suncream, waterproof plastic bags/ziplocks.  Yes, that's what I do when I prepare for trips.
```
## Q5) You indicated in the survey that you take vacation domestically, Most people say that travel has become more difficult  in the past 5 years, Tell me what types of changes you have observed when travelling and how these changes affected travelers or traveler's experiences.
```
Honestly, I don't think it has become more difficult than in the past few years. In fact, travelling has become easier. First
of all, there are many transportations now unlike before. For example, new express train called SRX is available. It's
a bit cheaper, faster and modern. The train station is not that far from my place too. It is clean, fast and
convenient. Additionally, in terms of changes, there are cheaper flights than before. Basically, this kind of
flight doesn't serve any food or drinks but its price is reasonable that's why  many people grap this opportunity
and I'm one of them. I actually took a flight to Jeju island and paid only 90,000 won for a round-trip ticket, which
was a great deal and driving has become much easier and faster because of the GPS system. It's really convenient so
many car drivers use it with their cellphones. It shows them the fastest way or route to their destination. I also can't imagine driving
without GPS nowadays.  I think travelling has become a lot easier rather than become more difficult.
```
## Q6) What are some issues or concerns people have related to taveling? What do people do to address those issues or concerns?.
```
Well, in terms of traveling, I guess safety is the biggest issue. In particular, people could get injured or get sick
while they are traveling. I believe people should take precautions to be safe. For an instance, when people are
near water or doing water activities, they have to make sure to follow safety precautions. For example, some people
don't warm up before they go into the water so they get cramps easily. As a result, they'll get drowned. 

I also  believe people should not visit dangerous area. Some people just like to visit where local people live especially
abroad. I will not recommend that because they can get in trouble. Getting out of secured tourist area can be dangerous
to travelers. For these reasons, I think safety is the most important thing people are worried about.
