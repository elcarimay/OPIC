# Do you remember a trip when you were a child? What did you do? What was the special thing in your trip?
```
I once went on a family trip to the beach.
During the trip, I played in the sand, swam in the ocean with a tube, built sandcastles, collected seashells, and took walks along the shore.

What made the trip really special was the opportunity to spend quality time with my family and enjoy the beautiful scenery.
It was a simple but memorable experience, and I really enjoyed every moment of it.

# Tell me about a place you visited when you were a child related to the geography in Korea. Where did you go? What did you do there?

When I was twelve years old, I visited Jeju Island, which is located off the southern coast of South Korea.
It’s a volcanic island with many unique geological features and natural attractions, such as waterfalls, beaches, and caves.

One of the most popular spots for visitors is Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, also known as “Sunrise Peak.”
I still remember the view — it was one of the most beautiful sceneries I had ever seen in my life.

Another famous site is Manjanggul Cave, a large lava tube formed by volcanic activity.
It was really cold inside the cave, and I started coughing, so I couldn’t wait to come out!

Besides its nature, the island is also known for its rich cultural heritage, including traditional houses and local cuisine.
Overall, Jeju is an ideal destination for families, with so much to explore and experience together.
