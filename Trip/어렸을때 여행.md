# Do you remember a trip when you were a child? What did you do? What was the special thing in your trip?

I might have gone on a family trip to a beach. During the trip, I had played in the sand, swam in the ocean
with tube, built sandcastles, collected seashells, and gone on walks along the shore. The special thing about
the trip had been the opportunity to have a good time with family members, enjoy the beautiful scenery.

# Tell me about a place you visited when you were a child related to the geography in Korea. Where did you go? What did you do there?

When I was twelve years old, I visited the Jeju Island, located off the southern coast of South Korea.
It is a volcanic island that has a variety of geological formings and natural attractions such as waterfalls, beaches, and caves.
One of the most popular place for visiters is the Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak,also known as the "Sunrise Peak."
It was a beatifual scenery in my life.
And another popular place is the Manjanggul Cave, which is a large lava tube cave that was formed by vocanic acitivity.
It was a very cold, so I coughed and expected it to come out as soon as possible.
Anyway, the island is also known for its cultural heritage, including its traditional houses, local cuisine,
making it an ideal destination for families to explore together.
