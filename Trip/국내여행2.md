I usually go camping and traveling with my family, and one of the most memorable trips was when we went to a camping site in Yangyang, Gangwon-do last summer.

It was about a three-hour drive from home, so it wasn’t easy to get there, but I was really excited to play in the water.
The weather was hot, but luckily there was a valley near the campsite, and the water was only about knee-deep, so we could safely enjoy the water.

There was a gentle slope, so we were able to enjoy natural water sliding with a tube.
My wife and son loved it, and we all had a lot of fun playing together.

The next day, we visited a nearby beach on the east coast.
Many people were surfing, and we spent more time playing in the ocean.
When we got tired, we just sat down on the ground, rested, and chatted.

As you know, food at tourist spots is usually expensive, but since we were camping, we brought and ate pre-prepared food at the campsite.
After dinner, we lit a campfire, and I spent some time just staring into the flames and spacing out.
Watching the fire made all my stress and busy thoughts disappear — it gave me a real sense of peace.

My son asked me if we could come back next summer.
To be honest, the long drive is a bit tiring, so I’ll have to think about it, but I know it was a really special trip for all of us.

## 2. Name the things you have to take on your trip and tell me the reasons you have to take them.

Packing for a trip is actually one of the fun parts of traveling for me.
No matter where I go or how long the trip is, there are a few must-have items I always bring.

First of all, I always pack sunscreen and sunglasses.
Since I’m usually the one driving, I’m often exposed to direct sunlight, so these two items are essential — especially in sunny places.
Sunglasses are a must for me when I’m on the road.

Of course, my smartphone is the most important item I carry.
Without it, I honestly can’t function! I use it to listen to music, check maps, browse the internet, and call my family while traveling.

The next thing I pack is a charging cable and charger.
Sometimes, I forget to charge my phone fully before I leave, and when I’m on the move, the battery drains quickly — especially if I’m using maps or taking photos.
In those cases, I usually stop by a nearby café to charge my phone.

If I’m traveling abroad, of course, I always take my passport.
But for domestic trips, I just carry my driver’s license or national ID card, which I usually keep in my wallet.

So those are the essential items I pack whenever I go on a trip.
Just thinking about packing makes me feel like going somewhere right now!

## 3. When was your last trip to some place in your country? Where did you go? What did you do there? Tell me something memorable that happened during the trip as much detail as possible.

About two weeks ago, I went to Busan with my family.
Busan is the second-largest city in Korea, located in the southern part of the peninsula.
It’s well known for its beautiful night views and delicious seafood dishes.

The trip was even better because my company provided free accommodation vouchers, so I booked an extra night and extended the trip.
Luckily, the weather was perfect during our stay.

We visited the Haeundae Aquarium, and it wasn’t just a regular tour — it included interactive experiences.
My son even got to feed sea turtles from a boat, and he absolutely loved it.
There were a lot of visitors, but it was definitely worth the money.

As expected, the night view at Gwangalli Beach was stunning.
There were lots of cafes lined up along the beach, and we could even see fireworks and firecrackers from boats.
It had been a long time since I last walked along a beach at night, so I really enjoyed it.
I took some nice night photos, and the atmosphere was great with lots of young people around.

One small downside was that parking at the hotel was difficult, and unfortunately, we couldn’t use the swimming pool.
But aside from that, everything else was perfect.

Overall, I think it was a very pleasant and memorable trip.
