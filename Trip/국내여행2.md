I usually go camping and traveling with my family. I went to a camping site in Yangyang, Gangwon-do last summer.
It was not easy to drive because it was about 3 hours away from home, but I was so excited to play in the water.
It was a hot weather, but there was a valley near the camping site, and the water level was about knees, so we
could play in the water. Because there was a slight slope, natural water sliding was possible, so we took a tube
and enjoyed playing in the water, and my wife and son loved it so much. The next day we went to a nearby beach
on the east coast. Many people were enjoying surfing and we played in the water. When we was tired of playing,
we sat on the floor, rested, and played. Usually, food is expensive when we go to tourist attractions, but since
we went camping, we ate pre-prepared food at the camping site. After dinner, the firewood was burning, I gazed
at a fire and space out. It seems that the complex idea disappears and the heart becomes comfortable while
watching. My son asked me to come here next summer, but it's hard to drive, so I have to think about it.

## 2. Name the things you have to take on your trip and tell me the reasons you have to take them.

Packing a bag for my trip is another fun part. Regardless of places and days of travel, I always pack my
sunscreen and sunglasses. I'm usually exposed to the sun because I'm in charge of driving. I know that
sunglasses should be used unconditionally in sunny places. Not to mention, my phone is something I need the most.
Without it, I cannot function at all. I can listen to the music, find the map, use internet, and call my family
while traveling. Next thing I put into my bag is charging cable and charger. Traveling without enough charging
happens occasionally to me. If I go from place to place and search for various things, the battery runs out
quickly. Just in case they happen, I usually go to nearby cafe for charging my phone. If I go abroad, I need my
passport with me. When I travel domestically a driversâ€™ license or national ID card is in my wallet. 
They are the usual things I take on my trip. By looking at these items, I would like to travel somewhere right now.

## 3. When was your last trip to some place in your country? Where did you go? What did you do there? Tell me something memorable that happened during the trip as much detail as possible.

About two weeks ago, I went to busan with my family. Busan is the second biggest city located in the southen part
of Korea peninsula. It is famous for its beautiful night view and delicious sea food dishes. The company gave out
free accommodation tickets, so I booked one more night. The weather condition is good. 
We went to the aquarium in Haeundae. It was not just an aquarium tour, but a variety of hands-on forms. He
experienced feeding sea turtles by boat, and he liked it. There were many people and it wasn't a waste of money.
As expected, the night view in the Gwangalli Beach is very good. There were many cafes on the beach and
firecrackers from boats could be seen on the beach. It's been a long time since I walked on the beach.
It was a night, but I took pictures and it was good because there were many young people. 
Parking in the hotel was difficult and it was regrettable that I couldn't use the swimming pool, but other than
that, it was perfect. I think it was a pleasant trip.
