In my country, South Korea, people often choose to travel to various Asian countries such as Japan,
China, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Among these, Japan is one of the most
popular destinations. I can provide some insights based on my experiences in Japan.

Japan is a favored destination due to its proximity to South Korea and geographical similarities.
Both countries share abundant natural features like mountains and rivers, with Japan being
approximately half-covered by mountains. 

Hot springs, known as onsen, are a significant attraction
in Japan due to its mountainous terrain. Additionally, Japan's status as an island nation means it
boasts numerous beautiful beaches. I had the pleasure of visiting Okinawa, Japan, with my family
a couple of years ago, and it was a fantastic experience.

## Q2) Now, tell me about a foreign country you visited when you were young. What was special about the visit? What do you remember doing?

This is a story about my wife's experience during her working holiday in Australia. On the last day
of her trip, she was at the airport going through immigration. The immigration officer requested
to see the credit card she had used to purchase her flight ticket. However, she had cut up the card
the day before, thinking she wouldn't need it anymore. In a moment of panic, she realized that she
had taken a photo of the card as a souvenir. She showed this photo to the immigration officer, who
accepted it as proof of payment. This incident left a lasting impression on her, and she's since
developed a habit of ensuring she has all necessary documents and cards before traveling.

## Q3) Tell me a story that you or people around you experienced when travelling overseas. What exactly happened, and what made that incident memorable?

Korean tourists typically focus on visiting tourist attractions when traveling abroad. These attractions
can include museums, historic sites, and iconic landmarks in the destination country. Additionally, they
often seek out the most popular and traditional local restaurants, capturing memories through
photographs of the delicious food. A prevalent trend among Korean tourists is carrying selfie sticks,
enabling them to take photos with friends and family without relying on strangers. Nowadays, many
young travelers prefer to experience local lifestyles by opting for accommodations like homestays
through platforms like Airbnb. This can lead to interactions with local residents and even the chance
to make new friends. 
Shopping is another significant activity for Korean tourists. While not everyone may be avid shoppers,
many travelers like to explore local markets and shops, purchasing items such as cosmetics, vitamins,
and unique local products. In summary, Korean tourists tend to blend sightseeing, cultural experiences,
and shopping to make the most of their overseas trips.

## Q4) Tell me about where tourists go and what they do on their overseas trips.
```
Korean tourists most often go to tourist attractions when they travel overseas. Tourist attractions are like museums, historic sites or landmarks in  
the country. Also, they visit the most popular and oldest local restaurants and never forget to take photo of the food. And most Korean people  
bring their selfie stiks and take a selfie with their friends and family. So, we don't need to ask strangers to take pictures any more.  
Nowadays, young people like to experience local life style so some of them choose to stay at local homestay like Airbnb. And some of them make a  
friend there. Shopping is another big thing people do. I'm not a big shopping person so I don't buy bunch of stuff like most people do, but most  
Korean tourist would just stop by and many things like local products like cosmetics, vitamins thing like that. I think.. that's all what Korean  
tourist do.
