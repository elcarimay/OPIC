In my country, South Korea, people often choose to travel to various Asian countries such as Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
Among these, Japan is one of the most popular destinations, and I’d like to share some insights based on my personal experience.

One reason why Japan is so popular is because of its close proximity to South Korea and its geographical similarities.
Both countries have abundant natural features like mountains and rivers, and in fact, about half of Japan is covered by mountains.

One of the highlights of traveling in Japan is enjoying the hot springs, known as onsen, which are popular thanks to the country’s mountainous landscape.
Also, since Japan is an island nation, it has many beautiful beaches, making it a great destination for both relaxation and sightseeing.

A couple of years ago, I had the chance to visit Okinawa with my family, and it was a fantastic experience.
The scenery was beautiful, the atmosphere was peaceful, and we really enjoyed exploring the unique culture and nature of the area.

## Q2) Now, tell me about a foreign country you visited when you were young. What was special about the visit? What do you remember doing?

This is a story about my wife’s experience during her working holiday in Australia.

On the last day of her trip, she was at the airport going through immigration when the officer asked to see the credit card she had used to purchase her flight ticket.
Unfortunately, she had cut up the card the day before, thinking she wouldn’t need it anymore.

In a moment of panic, she suddenly remembered that she had taken a photo of the card as a souvenir.
She quickly showed the photo to the immigration officer, and thankfully, he accepted it as proof of payment.

This incident left a strong impression on her, and since then, she has developed a habit of double-checking all necessary documents and cards before traveling.

## Q3) Tell me a story that you or people around you experienced when travelling overseas. What exactly happened, and what made that incident memorable?

Korean tourists usually focus on visiting famous attractions when they travel abroad.
These include places like museums, historic sites, and iconic landmarks in the destination country.

In addition, many Koreans love to visit popular and traditional local restaurants to try authentic food — and of course, they take lots of photos to capture the memories.
A common sight is Korean tourists using selfie sticks, which let them take photos with friends and family without asking strangers for help.

These days, younger travelers often prefer to experience the local lifestyle by choosing homestays through platforms like Airbnb.
This allows them to interact with local residents and sometimes even make new friends, which adds a special touch to the trip.

Shopping is also a big part of traveling for many Koreans.
Even if someone isn’t a serious shopper, they usually enjoy exploring local markets or shops to buy things like cosmetics, vitamins, or other unique local products.

So overall, Korean tourists tend to enjoy a mix of sightseeing, cultural experiences, and shopping to make the most of their time overseas.

## Q4) Tell me about where tourists go and what they do on their overseas trips.

Korean tourists usually visit famous tourist attractions when they travel overseas.
These places include museums, historic sites, and landmarks in the country.

They also love to go to popular and traditional local restaurants, and they never forget to take photos of the food.
Most Korean tourists bring selfie sticks and take selfies with their friends or family, so they don’t need to ask strangers to take pictures anymore.

These days, younger travelers often want to experience the local lifestyle, so some of them choose to stay at homestays, like Airbnb.
Sometimes, they even make new friends during their stay.

Shopping is also a big part of the trip for many Koreans.
Personally, I’m not a big shopper, so I don’t buy a lot of things, but most Korean tourists stop by local stores and buy items like cosmetics, vitamins, and other local products.

So overall, I think Korean tourists enjoy a mix of sightseeing, food, shopping, and cultural experiences when they travel abroad.
