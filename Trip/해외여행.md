Well.. As I know, most Koreans visit countries in Asia for their vacationplaces like Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Philippines  
are the most popular destination. And among them, one of the most popular destination is Japan. I also have been to Japan several times so let  
me tell you little bit about Japan. Japan is one of our closest neighboring countries. Also, Japan is very similar to Korea when it comes to  
geography. There are many mountains and river in Japan. In fact, roughly half of Japan is mountain. Due to these facts, hot spring is one of  
the most popular tourist attractions in Japan. Also, Japan is an island country, so there are tons of beaches. I went to Okinawa, Japan two year
ago for the first time and I had a great time with my family. In general, Japanese people are very polite. Furthermore, I love Japanese food,  
so I could have the best sushi and sake there. And I felt refreshed as I stayed at roykan which is traditional Japanese hotel.  
Yeah, overall.. Japan is one of the most popular tourist destination amoing Koreans.

## Q2) Now, tell me about a foreign country you visited when you were young. What was special about the visit? What do you remember doing?
```
I remember going on a trip to Guam with my family when I was a kid. It was my first trip to overseas, and I was very excited.  
As I remember, it took 5 hours by flight from Seoul. Anyway, when we arrived to the airport, we took a hotel shuttle and checked in at a hotel.  
And then, we went on a tour. Since it was a package tour, I remember tour guide led us and we just followed him.  
Since it was my first time to overseas, everything looked exotic to me. And I really had a great time there. People were very friendly and I  
loved its tropical weather. Also, I tasted local food with my family but I didn't like it. Yeah..kids are usually picky when it comes to food.  
I guess, and I was one of them pretty much but I loved local fruits. It was so fresh, juicy and sweet! And I ate only fruits 3 days in a row.  
We stayed there for 5 days and returned home.. I still remember that time. It was amazing.  
That's my trip to overseas as a kid.
```
## Q3) Tell me a story that you or people around you experienced when travelling overseas. What exactly happened, and what made that incident memorable?
```
Well there are so many things happen .. I guess .. especially when people don't understand cultural differences .. And this is what happended to  
my friend. When my friend was visiting Brazil for a business trip, he knew they have different body language .. so studied them and tried to be careful  
And things went well. however, after meeting with his clients, he wanted to say "Great" as he did thumb up, but his business partner was very offended  
at that time. He wasn't sure what was wrong and very soon he figured out it was a very big mistake. In Brazil, it's very assaulting. yeah. he was  
aware of it but it just happened spontaneously(자발적으로). He was very humiliated and had to apologize to them. Since then, he always tries to  
remember things not to do in other countries and be very careful. Yeah, this is pretty interesting.
```
## Q4) Tell me about where tourists go and what they do on their overseas trips.
```
Korean tourists most often go to tourist attractions when they travel overseas. Tourist attractions are like museums, historic sites or landmarks in  
the country. Also, they visit the most popular and oldest local restaurants and never forget to take photo of the food. And most Korean people  
bring their selfie stiks and take a selfie with their friends and family. So, we don't need to ask strangers to take pictures any more.  
Nowadays, young people like to experience local life style so some of them choose to stay at local homestay like Airbnb. And some of them make a  
friend there. Shopping is another big thing people do. I'm not a big shopping person so I don't buy bunch of stuff like most people do, but most  
Korean tourist would just stop by and many things like local products like cosmetics, vitamins thing like that. I think.. that's all what Korean  
tourist do.
