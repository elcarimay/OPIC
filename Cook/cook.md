## 1. You indicate in your survey that you like to cook. What kind of food do you like to cook? How often and when do you cook? Why do you like to cook? Tell me in details.

I became interested in cooking when I quit my previous company and took a break for about two months. I applied
for a cooking class for the first time in my life, but when I took the class, there were only women, but there
 were only two men. I learned a total of five things, but it's my first time making kimchi and soybean paste stew.
It was fun to learn anything at first, and it was so good to be praised by my wife for practicing at home. 
I posted it on my blog and printed it out just in case I forgot. I think the reason why cooking is fun is that
 it's better to cook and share it with people I like than to cook. And one thing I've learned is that taste comes
from condiments rather than ingredients themselves, so the real taste is in the mind. This is a little difficult,
but the taste is subjective, so everyone feels really different. In the end, I think that the standard of a
person's taste is determined by the taste of the person who cooked the food, that is, the mother's hand. 
These days, I think I'm curious about the taste of getting healthier as I get older.

## 2. What can you cook the best? Tell me about the recipe that you can cook the best.

As I said before, I learned cooking in cooking class and didn't actually learn much from my mother. I wish my
 mother had learned a lot before she got sick, but it's a pity. Anyway, I think curry is the best dish I've ever 
 cooked. You can trim and stir-fry any vegetables at home, pour water, and release them with curry powder. I think 
 it's a really simple and delicious dish. Sometimes I put fruit in it, but the apple succeeded and the tangerine failed.
I think it's better to add fruit with less juice. Of course, curry powder is bought at the store, but it is easy to
 cook, tastes not irritating, and is normal because it does not require any other seasonings and only needs to be
 trimmed with vegetables or fruits. The problem is that my wife doesn't like it, but it's okay because my son likes
it. It takes only about 20 minutes maximum. It is one simple and delicious meal I can cook.

## 3. Do you have any memorable experience while cooking? If you do, what happened? When did it happen? Tell me about it in as much detail as possible.
```
In the past, I suddenly wanted to make jajangmyeon, so I searched and found out that I could boil noodles and fry
chunjang. So I bought Chunjang from the mart and fried it, but it wasn't easy after I tried it. Chunjang has water
 inside, but if you fry it for a long time, it evaporates quickly and burns. I later found out that I had to fry it
for a long time over low heat, but it was too late. The problem was that I couldn't make jajangmyeon with charred
 chunjang. So, while cooking quickly, ramen was the only thing that tasted good, so I eventually made ramen and
never made jajangmyeon with chunjang again. It's an unforgettable memory. Recently, there was a Jajangmyeon meal
 kit at the mart that was ready to cook from chunjang to vegetable, so I bought it once, and it was easy to cook
and really delicious. I was so proud because my son said it was delicious. As expected, other people's dishes are
the most delicious.
