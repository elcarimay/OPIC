## 1. You indicate in your survey that you like to cook. What kind of food do you like to cook? How often and when do you cook? Why do you like to cook? Tell me in details.

I became interested in cooking after I quit my previous job and took a two-month break.
During that time, I signed up for a cooking class — it was actually my first time ever taking one.
When I joined, I noticed that most of the students were women, and there were only two men, including me.
In the class, I learned how to cook five different dishes.
It was my first time making kimchi and doenjang-jjigae (soybean paste stew), and it felt exciting to learn something completely new.
What made it even better was that I practiced at home and my wife praised me for the food I made.
I was so proud that I posted pictures on my blog and even printed the recipes, just in case I forgot them later.
What I’ve come to realize is that cooking is fun not just because of the process, but because I can cook for the people I care about.
It’s more meaningful when I share the food with others.
One interesting thing I’ve learned is that taste often comes from condiments and seasonings more than the ingredients themselves.
In a way, I think the real "taste" is in the heart — it’s a bit deep, but taste is so subjective. Everyone experiences it differently.

In the end, I think a person’s taste is shaped by the person who cooked for them most — like the taste of your mother’s cooking.
These days, as I get older, I find myself becoming more curious about healthy flavors and how food can nourish the body as well as the heart.

## 2. What can you cook the best? Tell me about the recipe that you can cook the best.
```
As I mentioned earlier, I learned cooking through a cooking class — I didn’t really learn much from my mother.
I wish I had learned more from her before she got sick, and that’s something I regret.

Anyway, I think the best dish I’ve ever cooked is curry.
You can just chop and stir-fry any vegetables you have at home, add water, and then mix in curry powder.
It’s a really simple and tasty dish. Sometimes, I even add fruit to it — once I tried apple, and it turned out great.
But when I added tangerine, it didn’t go well. I think it’s better to add fruits that have less juice.

Of course, I use store-bought curry powder, but the great thing is that it doesn’t need any extra seasoning.
Just vegetables or fruits are enough. It’s not too spicy or strong, and it’s easy to make.

The only problem is that my wife doesn’t like curry, but that’s okay — my son really enjoys it, and that makes me happy.
It only takes around 20 minutes to make, so it’s a simple and delicious meal I can prepare anytime.

## 3. Do you have any memorable experience while cooking? If you do, what happened? When did it happen? Tell me about it in as much detail as possible.
```
In the past, I suddenly had the urge to make jajangmyeon, so I searched online and found out that I needed to boil noodles and fry chunjang (black bean paste).
So, I went to the mart, bought some chunjang, and tried to fry it myself — but it turned out to be much harder than I expected.

I didn’t know that chunjang contains water, and if you fry it too long on high heat, the water evaporates quickly and it burns easily.
Later, I learned that you need to fry it slowly over low heat, but by then, it was already too late.
The chunjang was burnt, and I couldn’t use it to make jajangmyeon anymore.

While trying to save the meal, I quickly gave up and just made ramen instead — which luckily turned out great.
Since then, I’ve never tried to make jajangmyeon from scratch again.
It’s an unforgettable cooking fail.

But recently, I saw a jajangmyeon meal kit at the supermarket, and I gave it a try.
It came with pre-prepped chunjang and vegetables, and it was really easy to cook.
The best part was that my son said it was delicious, so I felt very proud.

As they say, food made by others always tastes better — and now I know why!
