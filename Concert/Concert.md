## 1) You indicated in the Survey that you often go to a concert. I'd like to know the most memorable concert you've seen. Tell me about the concert with lots of details.
```
When I was dating my wife, we went to see a performance at Yonsei University’s open-air theater in Seoul.
It was my first time attending an outdoor concert, so I was really looking forward to it.

What made it even more special was that one of my favorite singers, Kim Hyun-woo, was performing that night.
I sat next to my wife on a cool autumn evening, and we listened to beautiful Korean pop songs together.
The atmosphere, the music, and the moment were all so touching and unforgettable.

That’s the most memorable performance I’ve ever experienced.

## 2) Now, let's talk about the activites you enjoy doing at the concert hall. Tell me all of your activities you usually do at the concert hall from the beginning to the end.
```
When I arrive at the concert hall, I usually show my admission ticket at the entrance and check my seat number on the seating map.
Then, I like to take a few pictures to post on Instagram so my friends know what I’m up to.
I’m not sure if I mentioned this, but I usually go to concerts once or twice a year.

Once I’m inside, I usually grab a brochure and check out some information about the concert — like the performers and the band.
During the concert, I always turn off my phone so I can really focus on the atmosphere and enjoy the show without any distractions.

After the concert, I usually head home, but sometimes I stop by a nearby coffee shop.
I like to sit down, relax, and share my thoughts and feelings about the concert with my family.
It’s a nice way to end the day and talk about the experience.
```
## 3) When you go to a concert, where do you usually go? Please describe a concert hall you usually go to in detail.
```
Well, I think the concert hall I go to most often is the outdoor concert hall at a complex cultural center near my home.
The first time I went there, I saw a performance by a singer I had never heard of before.
Even though the singer wasn’t famous, a lot of people came to watch because it was outdoors and free.

There were no reserved seats, so people just sat on the grass, and many of them brought mats to sit on comfortably.
The atmosphere was very relaxed and casual, which made the experience more enjoyable.

One of the reasons I really like this concert hall is that it’s close to my house —
it only takes about 10 minutes by car or 20 minutes by bus, so it’s very convenient for me.

That’s all about the concert hall I usually go to.

### Role play  
__I'm sorry, but you have a problem to handle. Let's imagine that your friend and you planned to go to a concert hall. But you can't  
go with your friend because concert was cancelled. Call your friend, and leave a message. Explain the situation, and offer some  
solutions.__  
```
Hey buddy, it’s me.
I’m really sorry to say this, but the concert we were supposed to go to has been canceled due to severe weather.
I probably should’ve checked the weather forecast before suggesting it…
Anyway, I just wanted to apologize and offer you a couple of backup plans.

I have two options for you — feel free to choose whichever you prefer.
First, we could look for another singer’s performance to go to.
Or second, how about going camping instead?

Again, I’m really sorry about the cancellation.
Please think about it and let me know what you’d like to do.
Just get back to me as soon as you can!
