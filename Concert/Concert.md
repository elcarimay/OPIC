## 1) You indicated in the Survey that you often go to a concert. I'd like to know the most memorable concert you've seen. Tell me about the concert with lots of details.
```
When I was dating with my wife, I went to see a performance at Yonsei University's open-air theater in Seoul. It was my first
time going to see an outdoor performance, so I was looking forward to it. Also, it was a very special experience to watch the
performance of one of my favorite singers, Kim Hyun-woo. I sat next to my wife on an autumn night. It was so imperssive to hear
a touching ballad. That's all about the memorable performance I've experienced.

## 2) Now, let's talk about the activites you enjoy doing at the concert hall. Tell me all of your activities you usually do at the concert hall from the beginning to the end.
```
When I arrive at the concert hall, I usually show my admission tickets to get in and check my seat numbers on the seating map.  
Then I take some pictures to post on Instagram so my friends know what I'm doing. I'm not sure if I told you that, but I usually  
go to the concert at least once or twice a year. Anyway, once I get to the concert hall, I usually grab a brochure and check out  
some information of the concert such as performer and the bands. During the concert, I usually turn off my phone so I can feel its  
atmosphere and really into the show. After the show, I usually head to home but also like to go to coffee shop near the concert place.
So I can share my feeling with my family and talk about it.
```
## 3) When you go to a concert, where do you usually go? Please describe a concert hall you usually go to in detail.
```
Well..I think the concert hall that I often go to is the outdoor concert hall of the complex cultural center. When I first went
there, I saw a performance by an unknown singer. But it was outdoors and free, many people watched the performance, and there were
no reserved seats, so it was possible to watch it on the grass. There were also many people who opened the mat. The reason why I like
that concert hall is that it is not far from my house. It takes about 10 minutes by car and about 20 minutes by bus.  
These are all about the concert hall I usually go to.

### Role play  
__I'm sorry, but you have a problem to handle. Let's imagine that your friend and you planned to go to a concert hall. But you can't  
go with your friend because concert was cancelled. Call your friend, and leave a message. Explain the situation, and offer some  
solutions.__  
```
친구한테 전화 → 상황 설명 → 해결책(이거 아님 다른거 어때?) → 마무리 
Hey, buddy .. It's me .. I'm afraid to say this about the concert we are supposed to go together was canceled due to severe weather.  
I believe I had to check weather forecast before I suggested this concert .. but anyway .. I want to apologize for this .. and I  
would like to offer you some alternatives .. Backup plans .. I have two options for you and you can choose whatever you like.
First, why don't we look for another singer's performane?  
Second, How about going camping instead of the concert?  
Once again, I'm really sorry about this. And please consider my options for you and please let me know asap. Please get back to me
as soon as possible.
