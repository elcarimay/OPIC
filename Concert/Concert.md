When I arrive at the concert hall, I usually show my admission tickets to get in and check my seat numbers on the seating map.  
Then I take some pictures to post on Instagram so my friends know what I'm doing. I'm not sure if I told you that, but I usually  
go to the concert at least once or twice a year. Anyway, once I get to the concert hall, I usually grab a brochure and check out  
some information of the concert such as performer and the bands. During the concert, I usually turn off my phone so I can feel its  
atmosphere and really into the show. After the show, I usually head to home but also like to go to coffee shop or wine place near  
the concert place. So I can share my feeling with my friends and talk about it.

I usually go to the Seoul Olympic Stadium. It's located in the heart of Seoul city and many concerts are held at that place.  
Actually, it's one of the most popular concert place in Korea since it can accommodate about 15,000 crowds at once .. so  
not only concerts but lots of / numerous events such as magic show, play, circuses are held there. And, I went there when  
Micheal Buble visited Korea for Valentine's Day concert last year. When I go to a concert, I usually get a ticket in front row.  
So I can see the musician up-close. But It was already sold out when I tried to purchase/get it .. so I ended up sitting in the  
back. But this place/this concert hall has an incredible stereo system so I could feel its atmosphere lively even though I didn't  
get a seat in the front row. Anyway, these are all about the concert hall I usually go to.
