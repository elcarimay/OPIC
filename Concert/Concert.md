When I arrive at the concert hall, I usually show my admission tickets to get in and check my seat numbers on the seating map.  
Then I take some pictures to post on Instagram so my friends know what I'm doing. I'm not sure if I told you that, but I usually  
go to the concert at least once or twice a year. Anyway, once I get to the concert hall, I usually grab a brochure and check out  
some information of the concert such as performer and the bands. During the concert, I usually turn off my phone so I can feel its  
atmosphere and really into the show. After the show, I usually head to home but also like to go to coffee shop or wine place near  
the concert place. So I can share my feeling with my friends and talk about it.
