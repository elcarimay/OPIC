```
On weekdays, I usually wake up at 5:30 a.m. and start my day by taking care of my small pets and doing the leftover dishes from the night before.
After that, I wash my hair and get dressed, then put on my makeup while preparing for my English class at 6:40 a.m.

During the day, I work as a mechanical engineer at my companyâ€™s office.
After work, I come home and help my son with his homework while also taking care of my pets.
I make sure to do the dishes before settling down for the night and going to bed.
