Hi, there. Jay. This is Bobbi. I have some bad new regarding our upcoming trip.  
I just got a call from the travel agency. They told me that the package trip to  
Japan is fully-booked. I asked them to put us on the waiting list but I'm not sure  
we can make it unless somebody cancels their trip. Anyway, can you tell me  
what you want to do instead? Maybe we could contact other travel agency.  
Or, why don't we go to other places like Vietnam, Thailand, maybe China?  
Or, we could reschedule our trip to a different date. Anyway, think about this and  
let me know what you wanna do. I'm fine with anything. Give me a call when you get
this. Talk to you later. Bye Bye / Peace ~ 
```

Hi, I'm a person who booked a package trip to Thailand a few weeks ago. I'm supposed to  
go in the first week of February. But something came up and I'm not going to be able to  
make it. So, I would like to reschedule my trip to March.  
First of all, can you tell me if I can change my flight schedule? Plus, I wonder if I need  
to pay and penalty. If so, how much does it cost? Otherwise, I wonder if I could get a refund if  
I can't reschedule my flight. I'm so sorry for all the trouble. Please get back to me asap.  
Thank you / I appreciate for your help.

## Q13) 여행을 계획하는 단계에서 겪어본 어려움
## That's the end of the situation. You may have had problems while you were planning for trips. Talk about a problem you had while you were planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with the situation?
```
As I remember, I booked a flight ticket to Saipan earlier this year. But I entered my son's  
passport number with his old one, and before leaving the country, it should have been changed  
within 72 hours. The problem was that I knew it a day ago and thought about how to solve it.  
Eventually, the airline I asked for a phone call, but it was difficult because I couldn't get  
through, but it was nnected in about two or three times, and the airline manager changed it to a
new passport number at my request. It was such a relief, and I thought I should pay attention
to entering the passport number next time.

## I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You need to rent a car about week. call the rental car agency and ask 3-4 questions about the car you want to rent.

Hello, this is tony. I'm calling to inquire about renting a car. I'm thinking of renting a car for about  
a week. I would like to rent the car on the first week of December.  
So, I have a couple of questions for you. First of all, what kinds of cars are available?  
I need a rent a mid-size car. Also, what are the rates for the car? How much does it cost?  
Can you give me any recommendations? I wonder if you have any promotions going on currently.  
Plus, do you have a website I can check more information? Can you tell me where is your office /  
agency located? / What time do you open? / What time do you close?  
Do you provide pick-up service? Please let me know as soon as possible.  
Thank you / I appreciate that.

## I'm sorry, but there is problem I need you to resolve. You have received the rental car, but there are many problems with it. Call the rental agency and explain the situation. Give 2 or 3 alternatives.
```
Hello, this is tony. I'm a person who rented a car from your agency just now. Actually, I just got  
the car, but I'm afraid there are some problem with the car.  
So I have some questions for you. First of all, I can't start the engine. Plus, I don't think the car  
is cleaned up properly. So this car smalls terrible. That's why I'm very unhappy with this car.  
That's why I'm calling you.  
Anyway, I want to get a new car. I would like to stop by your office and check if other cars are  
available. Or I wonder if I could get a refund, if there's no other options for me.  
What time do you close? Please let me know asap. Thank you.
```
## Q23) That's the end of the situation. Have you ever rented a car from the rental car agency? Why did you rent the car? When and where did you rent the car? Give me all the details about that experience.
```
Well, I have rented a car multiple times, actually, I used to rent the car when I went to Jeju Island  
which is one of the best place to visit in Korea. And a public transpotation system is not available  
there. So I had to get it when I went there 5 year ago. Actually, I went there with my wife. The rental  
car I got was a small car but the fuel efficiency was good. Yeah, I was exhausted to go  
everywhere but we had a great time together. The beach was beautiful and I still can't  
forget the sunset. Yeah, that's pretty much everything with my rental car experience.
```
## Q31) I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to stay at a hotel for a trip, but you didn't make any reservation. Go to the reception desk and ask 3 or 4 questions to find out whether you can start at that hotel.
```
Excuse me, I don't have any reservation. But I would like to know if any rooms are available tonight.  
Do you have a vacancy for tonight? How much is the rate per night? / How much does it cost?  
What kind of rooms are available? / Do you have a ocean view room? Is breakfast included? Also, I wonder  
if you have any promotions going on currently. Yeah, sounds great. I will take that. Thank you for your  
help.
```
## Q32) I'm sorry, but there is a problem I need you to resolve. You have asked the hotel reception desk whether there is a room available. But there isn't any room available. Explain the situation to your travel companios, and make 2 or 3 suggestions to solve the problem.
```
Hey, guys I have some problem with a hotem room / checking-in. I just asked about vacancy/availability to  
the hotel. They told me that it's fully-booked at the moment. So we can't check-in unless someone cancels  
reservation. So can you tell me what you wanna do? Maybe we could check other hotel next door / across the  
street. Or, why don't we try check hotel apps with our phone? Anyway, can you tell me what you think?  
I'm fine with anything~
```
## Q33) That's the end of the situation. Talk about an unexpected incident that you have experienced during the trip. How did you manage to resolve the problem? Tell me everything that happened from beginnig to end.
