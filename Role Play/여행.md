Hi, there. Jay. This is Bobbi. I have some bad new regarding our upcoming trip.  
I just got a call from the travel agency. They told me that the package trip to  
Japan is fully-booked. I asked them to put us on the waiting list but I'm not sure  
if we can make it. Unless somebody cancels their trip. Anyway, can you tell me  
what you want to do instead? Maybe we could contact other travel agency.  
Or, why don't we go to other places like Vietnam, Thailand, maybe China?  
Or, we could reschedule our trip to a different date. Anyway, think about this and  
let me know what you wanns do / think. I'm fine with anything.  
Give me a call when you get this. Talk to you later. Bye Bye / Peace ~

Hi, I'm a person who booked a package trip to Thailand a few weeks ago. I'm supposed to  
go in the first week of February. But something came up and I'm not going to be able to  
make it. So, I would like to reschedule my trip to March.  
First of all, can you tell me if I can change my flight schedule? Plus, I wonder if I need  
to pay and penalty. If so, how much does it cost? Otherwise, I wonder if I could get a refund if  
I can't reschedule my flight.l I'm so sorry for all the trouble. Please get back to me asap.  
Thank you / I appreciate for your help.

## Q13) 여행을 계획하는 단계에서 겪어본 어려움
## That's the end of the situation. You may have had problems while you were planning for trips. Talk about a problem you had while you were planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with the situation?
```
As I remember, I was supposed to go on a trip with my close friends.  
So all of us were looking forward to going on a trip. Because vacation is  
always exciting and we could have a great time together.  
But the problem was I got really sick so I could not make it there.  
Actually I got into a car accident so I had to stay in the hospital for about  
a week. Fortunately, I was dischared from the hospital but I was very afraid of  
going somewhere. My doctor also recommended me to stay at home rather than going  
somewhere. So I got really pissed of but I had no choice but following my doctor's  
advice. Actually the accident was pretty bad so even after that, I had to go get a  
physical therapy for about 3 months. I felt terrible / I was frustrated / but there  
was nothing I could do. I still fell so sorry that I missed that trip since I planned  
all that but I told them to go without me. That's pretty much it.
```

Hello, this is tony. I'm a person who rented a car from your agency just now. Actually, I just got  
the car, but I'm afraid there are some problem with the car.  
So I have some questions for you. First of all, I can't start the engine. Plus, I don't think the car  
is cleaned up properly. So this car smalls terrible. That's why I'm very unhappy with this car.  
That's why I'm calling you.  
Anyway, I want to get a new car. I would like to stop by your office and check if other cars are  
available. Or I wonder if I could get a refund, if there's no other options for me.  
What time do you close? Please let me know asap. Thank you.
```
## Q23) That's the end of the situation. Have you ever rented a car from the rental car agency? Why did you rent the car? When and where did you rent the car? Give me all the details about that experience.
```
Well, I have rented a car multiple times, actually, I used to rent the car when I went to Jeju Island  
which is one of the best place to visit in Korea. And a public transpotation system is not available  
there. So I had to get it when I went there last spring. Actually, I went there with my girlfriends but  
nobody had a driver's license so I had to drive there for a week when I went there. The rental car I  
got was a small car but it was good enough gas efficiency wise. Yeah, I was exhausted to take them  
everywhere but we had a great time together. The beach was beautiful/breath-taking and I still can't  
forget the sunset. Yeah, that's pretty much everything with my rental car experience.
```
## Q31) I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to stay at a hotel for a trip, but you didn't make any reservation. Go to the reception desk and ask 3 or 4 questions to find out whether you can start at that hotel.
```
Excuse me, I don't have any reservation. But I would like to know if any rooms are available tonight.  
Do you have a vacancy for tonight? How much is the rate per night? / How much does it cost?  
What kind of rooms are available? / Do you have a ocean view room? Is breakfast included? Also, I wonder  
if you have any promotions going on currently. Yeah, sounds great. I will take that. Thank you for your  
help.
```
## Q32) I'm sorry, but there is a problem I need you to resolve. You have asked the hotel reception desk whether there is a room available. But there isn't any room available. Explain the situation to your travel companios, and make 2 or 3 suggestions to solve the problem.
```
Hey, guys I have some problem with a hotem room / checking-in. I just asked about vacancy/availability to  
the hotel. They told me that it's fully-booked at the moment. So we can't check-in unless someone cancels  
reservation. So can you tell me what you wanna do? Maybe we could check other hotel next door / across the  
street. Or, why don't we try check hotel apps with our phone? Anyway, can you tell me what you think?  
I'm fine with anything~
```
## Q33) That's the end of the situation. Talk about an unexpected incident that you have experienced during the trip. How did you manage to resolve the problem? Tell me everything that happened from beginnig to end.
