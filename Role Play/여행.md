Hi, there. Jay. This is Bobbi. I have some bad new regarding our upcoming trip.  
I just got a call from the travel agency. They told me that the package trip to  
Japan is fully-booked. I asked them to put us on the waiting list but I'm not sure  
if we can make it. Unless somebody cancels their trip. Anyway, can you tell me  
what you want to do instead? Maybe we could contact other travel agency.  
Or, why don't we go to other places like Vietnam, Thailand, maybe China?  
Or, we could reschedule our trip to a different date. Anyway, think about this and  
let me know what you wanns do / think. I'm fine with anything.  
Give me a call when you get this. Talk to you later. Bye Bye / Peace ~ 
```
## Q13) 여행을 계획하는 단계에서 겪어본 어려움
## That's the end of the situation. You may have had problems while you were planning for trips. Talk about a problem you had while you were planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with the situation?
```
As I remember, I was supposed to go on a trip with my close friends.  
So all of us were looking forward to going on a trip. Because vacation is  
always exciting and we could have a great time together.  
But the problem was I got really sick so I could not make it there.  
Actually I got into a car accident so I had to stay in the hospital for about  
a week. Fortunately, I was dischared from the hospital but I was very afraid of  
going somewhere. My doctor also recommended me to stay at home rather than going  
somewhere. So I got really pissed of but I had no choice but following my doctor's  
advice. Actually the accident was pretty bad so even after that, I had to go get a  
physical therapy for about 3 months. I felt terrible / I was frustrated / but there  
was nothing I could do. I still fell so sorry that I missed that trip since I planned  
all that but I told them to go without me. That's pretty much it.
