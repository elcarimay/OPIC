Hi Jay, it’s Tony. I have some unfortunate news about our upcoming trip.

I just got a call from the travel agency, and they told me that the package tour to Japan is fully booked.
I asked them to put us on the waiting list, but unless someone cancels, I’m not sure we’ll be able to go.

So I wanted to ask — what would you like to do instead?
We could try contacting a different travel agency, or maybe consider going somewhere else like Vietnam, Thailand, or even China.
Another option is to reschedule the trip for another date.

Anyway, think it over and let me know what you’d prefer.
I’m totally flexible, so I’m okay with whatever you decide.

Give me a call when you get this. Talk to you soon. Bye! 
```

Hello,

My name is Tony, and I booked a package trip to Thailand a few weeks ago.
The trip is scheduled for the first week of February, but unfortunately, something has come up and I won’t be able to make it.

I’d like to ask if it’s possible to reschedule the trip to sometime in March.
Could you please let me know:

Can I change my flight schedule?

Is there a penalty or extra fee for changing the date? If so, how much would it cost?

If rescheduling isn’t possible, am I eligible for a refund?

I’m really sorry for any inconvenience, and I appreciate your help.
Please get back to me as soon as possible.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Tony

## Q13) 여행을 계획하는 단계에서 겪어본 어려움
## That's the end of the situation. You may have had problems while you were planning for trips. Talk about a problem you had while you were planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with the situation?
```
As I remember, I booked a flight to Saipan earlier this year, but I made a mistake when entering my son's passport number.
I accidentally used his old passport number, and I later found out that it needed to be updated at least 72 hours before departure.

The problem was that I discovered this just one day before our flight, so I was really worried and wasn’t sure how to fix it in time.

I tried calling the airline, but it was hard to get through at first.
After two or three attempts, I finally got connected with a customer service representative, and I explained the situation.
Thankfully, the airline manager was able to update the booking with my son's new passport number.

It was such a relief, and I learned an important lesson — next time, I’ll be extra careful when entering passport information during the booking process.

## Q21) 렌터카 업체에 전화해서 문의하기
## I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You need to rent a car about week. call the rental car agency and ask 3-4 questions about the car you want to rent.
```
Hello, this is Tony. I'm calling to inquire about renting a car.

I'm planning to rent a car for about one week, starting in the first week of December.
I have a few questions:
1. What kinds of cars are available? I'm specifically looking for a mid-size car.
2. What are the rental rates? How much would it cost for a week?
3. Do you have any recommendations or current promotions I could take advantage of?
4. Do you have a website where I can check more details?
5.  Also, where is your office located? What are your opening and closing hours?
6. Lastly, do you offer any pick-up or delivery service?

I'd appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible.
Thanks in advance for your help!

## Q22) 렌트한 차에 문제가 있어서 해결 방법을 제시하기
## I'm sorry, but there is problem I need you to resolve. You have received the rental car, but there are many problems with it. Call the rental agency and explain the situation. Give 2 or 3 alternatives.
```
Hello, this is Tony. I just rented a car from your agency a short while ago, and I’m calling because I’m experiencing some issues with the vehicle.

First of all, I can’t start the engine, and I also noticed that the car doesn’t seem to be properly cleaned — it has a bad smell, which makes me very uncomfortable.
To be honest, I’m quite disappointed with the condition of the car.

So I’d like to ask:
1. Can I exchange this car for another one?
2. I’m planning to stop by your office — will there be other cars available?
3. If no replacement is available, would it be possible to get a refund?

Also, what time do you close today?
Please get back to me as soon as possible. I’d really appreciate your help.

Thank you.
```
## Q23) That's the end of the situation. Have you ever rented a car from the rental car agency? Why did you rent the car? When and where did you rent the car? Give me all the details about that experience.
```
Well, I’ve rented a car multiple times, and one memorable experience was when I traveled to Jeju Island — one of the best places to visit in Korea.
Since public transportation isn’t very convenient there, I had to rent a car when I visited about five years ago with my wife.

The car I rented was a small compact car, but it had really good fuel efficiency, which helped us save money on gas.
Although I was a bit tired from driving all over the island, we had an amazing time together.

The beach was beautiful, and I still can’t forget the view of the sunset — it was truly unforgettable.

Yeah, that’s pretty much everything about my rental car experience.
```
## Q31) I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to stay at a hotel for a trip, but you didn't make any reservation. Go to the reception desk and ask 3 or 4 questions to find out whether you can start at that hotel.
```
Excuse me, I don’t have a reservation, but I’d like to know if you have any rooms available for tonight.
Do you have a vacancy?
Also, could you tell me:
1. How much is the rate per night?
2. What types of rooms are available?
3. Do you have any ocean view rooms?
4. Is breakfast included in the room rate?
5. And do you have any special promotions or discounts going on right now?

That all sounds great — I’ll take the room.
Thank you very much for your help!
```
## Q32) I'm sorry, but there is a problem I need you to resolve. You have asked the hotel reception desk whether there is a room available. But there isn't any room available. Explain the situation to your travel companios, and make 2 or 3 suggestions to solve the problem.
```
Hey guys, I’ve got a bit of a problem with the hotel room check-in.
I just asked about room availability, and they told me it’s fully booked at the moment.
So unfortunately, we can’t check in unless someone cancels their reservation.

What do you guys want to do?
We could try checking another hotel nearby, maybe the one next door or across the street.
Or why don’t we try using a hotel app on our phones to look for something else?

Let me know what you think — I’m okay with anything!
```
## Q33) That's the end of the situation. Talk about an unexpected incident that you have experienced during the trip. How did you manage to resolve the problem? Tell me everything that happened from beginnig to end.
```
When I went to Italy around October last year, I bought some cup noodles and ate them at the dorm.
I boiled water using a coffee pot and was waiting for it to finish, but I completely forgot that European water has a high lime content.

When I looked it up, I found out that drinking water with too much lime can upset your stomach.
I thought about not eating the noodles, but I didn’t want to waste them — so I just ate them and went to sleep.

Luckily, nothing happened the next day.
If I had skipped the noodles just because of what I read online, I think I would’ve regretted it.
