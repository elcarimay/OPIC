Hi, there. Jay. This is Bobbi. I have some bad new regarding our upcoming trip.  
I just got a call from the travel agency. They told me that the package trip to  
Japan is fully-booked. I asked them to put us on the waiting list but I'm not sure  
if we can make it. Unless somebody cancels their trip. Anyway, can you tell me  
what you want to do instead? Maybe we could contact other travel agency.  
Or, why don't we go to other places like Vietnam, Thailand, maybe China?  
Or, we could reschedule our trip to a different date. Anyway, think about this and  
let me know what you wanns do / think. I'm fine with anything.  
Give me a call when you get this. Talk to you later. Bye Bye / Peace ~

## Q13) 여행을 계획하는 단계에서 겪어본 어려움
## That's the end of the situation. You may have had problems while you were planning for trips. Talk about a problem you had while you were planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with the situation?
