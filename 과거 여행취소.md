# Have you ever canceled plans because of something unexpected?

In general, Campers are sensitive to the weather, so they wake up, turn on the weather app in their cellphone, and
check the today's weather.
About one year ago,I was going to go camping early in the morning, but I couldn't go because of the bad weather.
Finally I ate breakfast at home in the morining with my family.
