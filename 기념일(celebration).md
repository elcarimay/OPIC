# 1. Talk about gaterings or celebrations in Korea. what do people do when they celebrate or get together?
```
There is a traditional celebration which is called "Seollal".
On these days, every family member gets together to celebrate the holiday.
They also talk about how they are doing.

They eat rice-cake soup called Tteok-guk. It is made of slices of rice cake, beef, eggs, etc.
When Koreans eat Tteok-guk, they believe that they get a year older. It's an old tradition.

They play some Korean traditional game,Yut-nori. It's a kind of a board game.
One special thing is that they hold a memorial service for their ancestors.

Nowadays, I can see many people travel abroad or nearby to spend their national holidays.

# 2. what did they do at their last gathering or celebration? what was the occasion?
```
At the last Seollal gathering, family members came together to celebrate the new year and honor their ancestors.
The occasion was especially significant because it was the first time that the entire family had been able to
gather in person.

The day started off with everyone gathering around a large table set with traditional foods, such as tteokguk
(rice cake soup), jeon (Korean pancakes), and various types of fruit. 
The family members took turns bowing to each other and wishing each other good health. 
→ 절하다의 bow는 /bau/로 발음하지만, 활은 /bou/로 발음함.

They also performed ancestral rites, setting out offerings of food and drink for their ancestors and bowing in respect.
After the formal ceremonies were finished, the family spent the rest of the day playing games, telling stories, and
catching up on each other's lives. One of the favorite games was yunnori, a traditional board game that involves
throwing sticks and moving game pieces around a board.

As the night drew to a close, the family members gathered together once more for a final feast of delicious food and drink.
The atmosphere was one of warmth, love, and gratitude for the opportunity to be together as a family once again.

Overall, the Seollal gathering was a joyful occasion filled with meaningful ceremony, delicious food, and
cherished moments of togetherness. It was a reminder of the importance of family.

# 3. Talk about a memorable incident that happened at a gathering or a celebration. what happened?
```
At a family gathering for Seollal, everyone was sitting down to enjoy a big feast of traditional Korean dishes.
As they were passing around dishes of steaming hot food, one of the younger children accidentally spilled
a bowl of doenjang jjigae all over their grandmother's lap.

At first, everyone was shocked and didn't know what to do. But the grandmother simply laughed and
said that it was no big deal - accidents happen! She quickly got up to change her clothes,
while the rest of the family scrambled to clean up the mess.

Despite the unexpected incident, the rest of the gathering continued on with even more laughter and joy.
The family members all worked together to finish preparing the rest of the food, and 
everyone sat down to enjoy the delicious spread.

In the end, the incident actually brought the family closer together and became a fond memory 
that they still talk about to this day. It was a reminder that sometimes the most unexpected things can
bring people together and create unforgettable moments.
